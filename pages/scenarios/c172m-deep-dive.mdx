# 1973 Cessna 172M Deep Dive

The following is a detailed exploration of a specific aircraft model based on
information from the POH, TCDS, and other resources.

Source materials:

-   [Pilot's Operating Handbook](https://mentoneflyingclub.org/aircraft/N12874POH.pdf)
-   [Type Certificate Data Sheet](https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/814b2fb4dc1615008625871e005ed037/$FILE/3A12_Rev86.pdf)

## Vacuum System

## Fuel System

-   Two fuel tanks, one in each wing
    -   21 gallons per side, 19 gallons usable
    -   42 gallons total, 19 gallons total usable
-   Total usable fuel is 19 gallons per side, for a total of 38 gallons
-   Fuel is gravity fed to the selector valve, then through a fuel strainer and
    then to the carburetor
-   The fuel selector value should be used as follows:
    -   BOTH for takeoff, landing, or anything maneuver involving prolonged
        slips/skids
    -   LEFT or RIGHT for cruising flight

## Electrical System

The electrical system consists of a 14-volt DC system, powered by an
engine-driven alternator. A 12-volt battery is located on the left-hand portion
of the firewall.

There are two buses, one for general electrical equipment, and on for electronic
equipment. When the ignition/starter switch is turned on, a power contactor
opens the electronic bus circuit, preventing harmful voltage from damaging the
electronics.

The master switch consists of two halves:

-   Left half controls the alternator connection to the system
-   Right half controls the battery connection to the system

The ammeter will show a positive charge when the battery is charging, and a
negative charge when it is discharging faster than the alternator can charge it.

There is an over-voltage system, which includes a warning light labelled HIGH
VOLTAGE.

-   When the light is on, the system has removed the alternator from the
    electrical system.
-   If this occurs resetting the alternator (turning the master off then on),
    may reset the alternator in some cases.
-   This can also be tested by momentarily turning off the ALT portion of the
    master.

### Circuit Breakers

Most circuits are protected via "push to reset" circuit breakers on the front of
the instrument panel. Exceptions are:

-   Clock
-   Hobbs meter
-   Cigarette lighter

### Lighting

Lighting consists of:

-   Flashing red beacon
-   Navigation lights on each wingtip
-   Landing and taxi light in the front cowling
-   Overhead dome light

## Wing Flaps

Wing flaps are electrically operated by a motor in the right wing.

-   The flaps operate in a 0&deg; to 40&deg; range.
-   Full extension of the flaps takes approximated 9 seconds
-   Full retraction of the flaps takes approximately 7 seconds
-   The three-way switch can be returned to the center position once the flaps
    are up
-   If side slips are used with full rudder deflection and flaps more than
    30&deg;, some elevator oscillation may be felt. However, this does not
    affect the control of the aircraft.

## Heat and Ventilation

-   Front cabin heat and ventilation are provided via outlet hoses under the
    pilots' feet.
-   Rear cabin heat and ventilation comes from hoses which end on each side of
    the rear cabin at floor level
-   Window defrost air is supplied by a duct leading from the cabin manifold

## Seatbelts

-   Shoulder and lap belts are provided for the front seats
-   Lap belts are provided for the rear seats

## Operations

### Starting

-   Open throttle 1/8" inch
-   1-2 strokes of primer should be sufficient in warm weather
-   Up to 6 strokes may be necessary in cold temperatures
-   If the engine is warm, no priming is required
-   Oil pressure should be up within 30 second of starting in warm weather, or
    about 60 second in very cold weather. Otherwise, stop the engine

#### Cold-Weather Starting

-   Prior to starting, pull the propeller through several times
-   Use an engine preheater in extremely cold weather

### Taxiing

-   Carb heat should always be off for ground operations, as the intake air is
    unfiltered with carb heat on.

### Takeoff

-   When taking off at >3000' MSL, the mixture should be leaned for max RPM in
    the runwup prior to takeoff.
-   Normal and obstacle clearance takeoffs are performed with wing flaps up
-   10&deg; of flaps may be used for soft/rough fields, or where a minimum
    ground run is desireable.
    -   In this case, use a obstacle clearance speed of 65 MPH
-   Crosswind takeoffs are performed
    -   With minimum flaps
    -   Allow the airplane to accelerate slightly more than usually
    -   Abruptly pull the airplane off the runway to prevent it settling back
        down

### Climbs

-   Climb at 80-90 MPH
-   Mixture should be full rich below 3000' MSL
-   Mixture should be leaned for max RPM and smooth engine operation above 3000'

### Cruise

-   Cruise between 65% and 75% power

### Carbuerator Ice

Carb ice is evidence by an unexplained drop in RPM.

-   It can redmedied by full application of carb heat.
-   Afterwards, use the minimum amount of heat necessary to form icing.
-   Use full carb heat during flight in heavy rain
-   In extremely heavy rain, partial carb heat and partial throttle may be
    needed to maintain power

### Stalls

-   The stall horn will come upon around 5-10 MPH above stall in all
    configurations

### Spins

Spin recovery is performed:

1. Retard the throttle to idle.
2. Apply full opposite rudder in the opposite direction of the turn.
3. Move the control wheel forward in a brisk motion.
4. Neutralize the rudder as the rotation stops, and make a smooth recovery from
   the dive

### Landings

-   Short field landings are done with power off, 40 &deg; of flaps, and
    approximately 69 MPH airspeed.
-   Crosswind landings should be done with minimum flap setting
-   With average pilot technique, a direct crosswind of **15 knots** can be
    handled safely.

## Go-Arounds

1. Apply full power
2. Reduce wing flaps to 20&deg;
3. Once a safe altitude is reached above obstacles, retract the reset of the
   flaps.

## Emergency Procedures

### Electrial Power System Malfunctions

-   Excessive rate of charge
    -   The ammeter should show less than two needle-widths of charge once
        established in cruise flight.
    -   If the charge reaches 16 volts, the protection system will shut off the
        alternator
-   Insufficient rate of charge
    -   Usually caused by a alternator failure, or failure of the alternator
        belt
    -   In this case, load-shed off the battery and land

### Rough Engine or Loss of Power

-   Gradual loss of RPM is usually indicative of carburetor ice
-   Roughness could also be related to an improperly set mixture
-   Spark plug fouling is indicated by rough, low power engine when operating on
    one set of magnetos
    -   If the problem persists, try operating a leaner mixture

### Magneto Malfunction

Sudden engine roughness is usually evidence of magneto problems. Switch from
LEFT or RIGHT to determine which set is malfunctioning, then run on the good
side. Land as soon as you can.

### Low Oil Pressure

-   Can be caused by th oil pressure gauge malfunctioning
-   A leak in the line to the gauge isn't necessarily an emergency, as there is
    an orifice that prevents a sudden loss of oil from the engine sump
-   A loss of pressure and a rise in oil temperature is reason to suspect an
    imminent engine failure:
    -   Reduce power and select a suitable forced landing field

### Engine Fire While Starting

-   Continue cranking the engine until start
-   If the engine starts, run at 1700 RPM for a few minutes before shutting down
-   If the engine does not start, continue cranking until fire extinguishers can
    be obtained

### Engine Fire in Flight

1. Mixture to idle cutoff
2. Turn off fuel selector valve
3. Master switch off
4. Establish a 120 MPH glide
5. Close cabin heat
6. If fire does not extinguish, find an airspeed that results in an
   incombustible mixture
7. Execute a forced landing

## Engine

150 HP Lycoming O-320-E2D

### Oil

-   Oil type: SAE 20
-   Do not operate with less than 6 quarts of oil
-   Fill to 8 quarts for extended flights

## Landing Gear

-   Tire Pressures:
    -   Nose Wheel: 231 PSI
    -   Main Wheels 29 PSI
-   Nose gear Shock:
    -   Keep filled with hydraulic fluid and inflated with air to 45 PSI
