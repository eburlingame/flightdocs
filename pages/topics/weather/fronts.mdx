# Fronts

Fronts exists at the edges of air masses, where another type of air (usually
warmer or colder) is replacing the existing air.

## Cold Fronts

Cold fronts replace warmer air with colder air. Cold fronts typically have a
steep slope vertically, where the warmer air is forced upward by the cold air
moving in below.

This often causes a narrow band of showers near or just ahead of the front.
Thunderstorms are also possible if this warm air is unstable.

As a cold front passes, weather can include:

- Towering cumulus or cumulonimbus
- Heavy rain or hail
- Tornados possible
- Poor visibility
- Winds variable and gusting

## Warm Fronts

Warm fronts replace colder air with warmer air. Warm fronts typically have a
longer, more gentle slope, as the warm air overtakes the cold air below it. This
supports the development of widespread, layered, stratiform clouds and
precipitation.

As a warm front passes, weather can include:

- Drizzle
- Low ceilings
- Poor visibility
- Variable winds

## Stationary Fronts

A stationary front is one that is largely unmoving.

## Occluded Front

An occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold front catches up to a
slower-moving warm front. As the two fronts merge, cloud and precipitation is
likely.

A cold front overtakes a warm front.
