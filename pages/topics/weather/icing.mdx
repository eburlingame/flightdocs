# Aircraft Icing

Aircraft icing poses a very significant hazard to aircraft. Ice on an airplane
can have a diminishing affect on almost all aspects of performance, including:

- Increased weight
- Increased drag
- Decreased lift
- Decreased thust

## Rime Icing

Rime ice forms when drops are small, such as those in stratified clouds or light
drizzle. The liquid portion remaining after initial impact freezes rapidly
before the drop has time to spread over the aircraft surface.

Rime ice looks brittle and frost-like.

## Clean Icing

Clear ice forms when, after initial impact, the remaining liquid portion of the
drop flows out over the aircraft surface gradually freezing as a smooth sheet of
solid ice. This type forms when drops are large as in rain or in cumuliform
clouds.

## Mixed Icing

Mixed ice forms when drops vary in size or when liquid drops are intermingled
with snow or ice par-ticles. It can form rapidly. Ice particles become imbedded
in clear ice, building a very rough ac-cumulation sometimes in a mushroom shape
on leading edges.

## Intensity

- Trace: Perceptible, no significant accumulation
- Moderate: Significant accumulations for shorter periods of flight
- Severe: Rapid, dangerous accumulations
