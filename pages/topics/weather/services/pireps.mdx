# Pilot Reports (PIREPs)

A PIREP is a pilot-issued report which describes weather at a given location at
a given time.

They can be standard (denoted `UA`), or urgent (denoted `UUA`).

They often contain height/bases of clouds, wind shear, turbulence, or icing.

They are reported in altitude MSL, visibilities in statute miles, and distance
in NM.
