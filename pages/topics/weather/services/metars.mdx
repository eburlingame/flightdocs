# Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)

A METAR is a weather report for a specific place and time, encoded in a
standardized format.

METARs include:

- Day of the month and zulu time of observation
- Wind (given relative to true north)
- Visibility
- Cloud cover (ceilings given in AGL)
- Temperature and dewpoint
- Altimeter
- Remarks

METARs are published hourly, however if conditions change rapidly, a SPECI
report may be issued.

Some example METARs:
