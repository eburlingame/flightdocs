# Surface Analysis Charts

Surface analysis charts are analyzed charts of surface weather observations. The
chart depicts the distribution of several items, including sea-level pressure;
the positions of highs, lows, ridges, and troughs; the location and type of
fronts; and the various boundaries such as drylines.

The [Aviation Weather Center](https://aviationweather.gov/) publishes the
[WPC Surface Prog Chart](https://aviationweather.gov/progchart/sfc).
