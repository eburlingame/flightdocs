# Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B)

The Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) provides updated weather and
flight information directly into the cockpit via the ABS-B system. It operative
over the UAT (978 MHz) data link.

Some weather products than can be received via FIS-B include:

-   Graphical AIRMET
-   Center Weather Advisory (CWA)
-   METARs / TAFs
-   Cloud Tops
-   Icing
-   NEXTRAD Radar

Be aware that data received from FIS-B can be as much as **5-15** minutes old by
the time it is displayed in the cockpit. Never use FIS-B NEXTRAD data to
circumnavigate a thunderstorm.

# Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B)

Similar to FIS-B, the Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) provides
position of nearby traffic to the cockpit via ground stations. These ground
stations aggregate traffic from ADS-B Out sources (978 MHZ or 1090ES
transponders). FIS-B receivers can operate on either 978 MHZ or 1090ES.

-   TIS-B is only available below 24,000 feet.
-   You will receive TIS-B targets that are within a **15nm** and +/- **3500'**
    of your aircraft
