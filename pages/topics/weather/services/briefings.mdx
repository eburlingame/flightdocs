## Using Unofficial Weather Sources

AIM 7-1-3 discusses weather that comes from third party vendors, not official
Flight Service or NWS systems:

> Pilots and operators should be aware that weather services provided by
> entities other than FAA, NWS or their contractors (such as the DUATS and FISDL
> providers) may not meet FAA/NWS quality control standards. Hence, operators
> and pilots contemplating using such services should request and/or review an
> appropriate description of services and provider disclosure. This should
> include, but is not limited to, the type of weather product (e.g., current
> weather or forecast weather), the currency of the product (i.e., product issue
> and valid times), and the relevance of the product. Pilots and operators
> should be cautious when using unfamiliar products, or products not supported
> by FAA/NWS technical specifications.
