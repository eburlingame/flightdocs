pertains to significant types of weather.

They are issued for:

-   Severe icing
-   Severe or extreme turbulence
-   Dust or sand storms lowering visibility to < 3 miles

# Convective SIGMETs

Convective SIGMETs are issued for significant convective weather, including:

-   A line of thunderstorms, at least 60 miles long with thunderstorms affecting
    40% of its length
-   Area of thunderstorms covering at least 40% concerned area and exhibiting a
    very strong radar reflectivity
-   Embedded or sever thunderstorms expected to occur for more than 30 minutes

Any convective SIGMET implies severe turbulence, severe icing, and low level
wind shear.
