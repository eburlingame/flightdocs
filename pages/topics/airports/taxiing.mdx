# Taxiing

## Taxi Clearances

- ATC is required to get a correct readback of all runway hold short
  insructions, so never omit the destination runway from your readback.
  - For instance: "Taxi to and hold short of runway 34."

or potential risk of collision or runway incursion, and where **heightened
attention by pilots and drivers is necessary**.
