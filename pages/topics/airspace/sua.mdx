# Special Use Airspace

## Prohibited Areas

Prohibited areas established for security or other reasons in which flight is
completely prohibited.

## Restricted Areas

Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to
aircraft such as artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles.

Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or
controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants.

You need permission from the controlling agency to fly in a restricted area. If
you are flying IFR, they will do this for you, or route you around it.

## Warning Area

Warning areas extend three nautical miles outward from the coast of the U.S.,
and contains activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft.

A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both.

## Military Operation Areas (MOAs)

Military operation areas are established for the purpose of separating certain
military training activities from IFR traffic.

Pilot are permitting to fly though a MOA at any time, even when it is active.
Pilots should exercise extreme caution while flying within a MOA when it is
active.

If flying under IFR, ATC will clear you though the area if separation can be
provided, or route you around it.

Under VFR, the pilot should contact the controlling agency and determine whether
the MOA is active.

## Alert Areas

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts to inform nonparticipating
pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual
type of aerial activity.

Pilots should be particularly alert when flying in these areas.
