# Other Airspace

## Military Training Routes

Military training routes are used for military flight training by high
performance aircraft.

MTRs are established below 10,000â€‰feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of
**250 knots**.

-   IFR Military Training Routes are labelled IR-####
-   VFR Military Training Routes are labelled VR-####

The routes above 1,500 feet AGL are developed to be flown are generally flown
under IFR. The routes at 1,500 feet AGL and below are generally developed to be
flown under VFR.

-   Routes with no segments above 1,500' AGL will be labelled with 4 letters,
    e.g., IR1206, VR1207
-   Route with segments above 1,500' AGL must be identified by three number
    characters; e.g., IR206, VR207

## Terminal Radar Surface Areas

A TRSA is a non-regulatory piece of airspace that provides additional services
around a busy Class D airport. These are technically non-part 71 airspaces.

TRSAs have their own approach control, which can provide separation services to
IFR traffic and participating VFR traffic. Participation in a TRSA is
technically voluntary, however.

## Temporary Flight Restrictions

Temporary flight restrictions are areas where flight is temporarily restricted
for a variety of reasons. They are issued via TFR NOTAM.

They can be issued for:

-   Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing
    or imminent hazard associated with an incident on the surface
-   Provide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft
-   Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident
-   Protect the President, Vice President, or other public figures
-   Provide a safe environment for space agency operations

Note that even under IFR, it is not legal to fly into a TFR unless prior
permission has been arranged. Even if you have been cleared into a TFR on an IFR
flight plan, you should double check with the controller that you are able to
enter the airspace.
