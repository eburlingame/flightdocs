# Air Defense Identification Zone

Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) means an area of airspace over land or
water, in which the ready identification, location, and control of all aircraft
(except Department of Defense and law enforcement aircraft) is required in the
interest of national security.

Conducting operations in the ADIZ requires:

- A Mode C transponder
- Two-way radio contract with the appropriate facility
- An IFR or [DFVR flight plan](/topics/navigation/flightplans)

## Land-based ADIZ

Land-Based ADIZ are activated and deactivated over U.S. metropolitan areas as
needed by NOTAM.
