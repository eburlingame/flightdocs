# Hyperventilation

Hyperventilation is the excessive rate and depth of respiration leading to
abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood. This condition occurs more often
among pilots than is generally recognized.

Breathing normally is both the best prevention and the best cure for
hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the breathing rate, breathing into a
paper bag or talking aloud helps to overcome hyperventilation.

## Symptoms

-   Visual impairment
-   Unconsciousness
-   Lightheaded or dizzy sensation
-   Tingling sensations
-   Hot and cold sensations
-   Muscle spasms
