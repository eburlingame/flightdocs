# Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless gas produced by engines.

CO attaches to hemoglobin in the blood about 200 times more easily than oxygen,
and prevents the blood from carrying oxygen to the cells. This results in a form
of hypoxia called [hypemic hypoxia](/topics/aeromedial/hypoxia).

-   The body requires up to 48 hours to dispose of CO
-   If a strong odor of exhaust gases is detected, assume that CO is present
-   Heat or air vents in an airplane may pass over some part of the exhaust
    system. Turn them off if you smell exhaust.

## Symptoms

-   Headache
-   Blurred vision
-   Dizziness
-   Drowsiness
-   Loss of muscle power
