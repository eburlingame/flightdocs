# Carburetors

In the operation of the float-type carburetor system, the outside air first
flows through an air filter, usually located at an air intake in the front part
of the engine cowling. This filtered air flows into the carburetor and through a
venturi, a narrow throat in the carburetor. When the air flows through the
venturi, a low-pressure area is created that forces the fuel to flow through a
main fuel jet located at the throat.

## Carburetor Icing

Carburetor ice occurs due to the effect of fuel vaporization and the decrease in
air pressure in the venturi, which causes a sharp temperature drop in the
carburetor.

If water vapor in the air condenses when the carburetor temperature is at or
below freezing, ice may form on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including
the throttle valve.

Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperatures are below **70&deg;F**
(Â°F) and the relative humidity is above **80%**.

Due to the sudden cooling that takes place in the carburetor, icing can occur
even in outside air temperatures as high as **100&deg;F** and humidity as low as
**50%**.
