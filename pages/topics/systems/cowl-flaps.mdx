# Cowl Flaps

Cowl flaps are used to control the temperature of the engine by regulating the
amount of air that flows through the engine compartment. They are typically
located on the bottom of the engine cowling and can be opened or closed by a
control in the cockpit.

## Operation

- Open the cowl flaps before starting the engine and keep them open through
  takeoff
- Cowl flags can be kept open during climb, or closed as long as the engine
  temperatures remain within limits
- Close the cowl flaps during cruise, keeping an eye on engine temperatures
- Cowl flaps can be kept closed during descent to prevent shock cooling
