# Constant-Speed Propellers

Constant-speed propellers are a type of propeller that can change pitch to
maintain a constant RPM. This allows the engine to operate at its most efficient
RPM for a given flight configuration.

## Components

Changing the pitch of the propeller is accomplished by a governor, which is
housed in the spinner.

The governor uses a combination of flyweights and springs to regulate how much
oil should be let into the propeller hub.

- When the engine RPM **increases**, the flyweights move outward, which opens a
  valve and oil flows into the the propeller hub. This causes the propeller
  blades to flatten out, decreasing the pitch and reducing the engine RPM.
- When the engine RPM **decreases**, the flyweights move inward, which opens the
  valve and oil flows out of the propeller hub. This causes the propeller blades
  to increase pitch, increasing the engine RPM.

## Operation

The constant-speed propeller is controlled by the propeller control lever in the
cockpit. The propeller control lever is connected to the governor by a series of
linkages.

- Moving the propeller control in increases the RPM by increasing the pitch of
  the propeller blades.
  - This is typically used for takeoff and climb when you want to maximize
    thrust and RPM.
- Moving the propeller control out decreases the RPM by decreasing the pitch of
  the propeller blades.
  - This is typically used for cruise when you want to maximize fuel efficiency.

## Loss of engine oil pressure

If a loss of oil pressure occurs, most airplanes will fail into the low pitch
position. This is because the governor is spring-loaded to return to the low
pitch position if oil pressure is lost.
