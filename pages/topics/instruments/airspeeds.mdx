# Type of Airspeeds

-   Calibrated airspeed (CAS): Indicated airspeed corrected for position or
    instruments errors
-   Equivalent airspeed (EAS): Calibrated airspeed corrected for adiabatic
    compressible flow errors
-   True airspeed (TAS): This is calibrated airspeed corrected for nonstandard
    temperature and pressure
    -   The speed at which the aircraft is moving through the airmass
-   Mach number: Ratio of the TAS to the speed of sound
-   Ground speed: Actual speed over the ground

## V-Speeds

-   **V<sub>X</sub>**: Best angle of climb speed
    -   The fastest rate of climb per foot travelled over the ground
-   **V<sub>Y</sub>**: Best rate of climb speed
    -   The fastest rate of climb per second
-   **V<sub>N0</sub>**: Maximum structural cruising speed
    -   Don't exceed this speed unless in smooth air
-   **V<sub>A</sub>**: Design maneuvering speed
    -   The maximum speed where the structural design limit can be imposed (via
        full control deflection or gusts) without causing structural damage
    -   The airplane will stall before it will exceed a critical load factor
    -   The maneuvering speed increases as weight increase
-   **V<sub>FE</sub>**: Maximum flaps extended speed
-   **V<sub>LE</sub>**: Maximum landing gear extended speed
    -   The maximum speed where that can be flown with the landing gear extended
-   **V<sub>LO</sub>**: Maximum landing gear operating speed
    -   The maximum speed where the landing gear can be extended or retracted
-   **V<sub>NE</sub>**: Never exceed speed
-   **V<sub>S1</sub>**: Stall speed in a clean configuration
-   **V<sub>S0</sub>**: Stall speed in the landing configuration
