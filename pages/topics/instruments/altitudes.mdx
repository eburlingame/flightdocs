# Altitude Types

-   Indicated altitude
    -   Read directly off the altimeter, after it is set to a correct altimeter
        setting
-   Pressure altitude
    -   Read directly off the altimeter when it is set to 29.92" Hg
-   Density altitude
    -   Pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature variation
    -   Said another way, it is the height of the aircraft in standard
        atmosphere based on the current temperature and pressure conditions
-   True altitude
    -   True altitude is the vertical distance above mean sea level (MSL)
-   Absolute altitude
    -   The vertical distance above the terrain
