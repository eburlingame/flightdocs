# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)

The airspeed indicator displays an approximation of the aircraft's airspeed,
based on the difference between pitot pressure and the static pressure.

## Errors

-   Position errors
    -   Errors caused by erroneous pressure from the static port, usually caused
        by a specific flight attitude or configuration
-   Density errors
    -   The instrument is not corrected for nonstandard temperature or pressure,
        including the effects of altitude
-   Compressibility errors
    -   At high speeds, the packing of air into the pitot tube can result in
        higher than normal readings. At low airspeed this is not significant
