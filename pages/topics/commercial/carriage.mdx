A common carrier is a person OR organzation that will **"hold itself out"** to the public, or to a segment of the public

- Common carriers are required to operate under Parts 121 or 135.
- There are four elements in defining a common carrier:
  1. a holding out of a willingness to
  2. transport persons or property
  3. from place to place
  4. for compensation.
- This "holding out" make a person a common carrier and can be done in many ways, including:
  - Advertizing your services as a pilot
  - Showing a willingness to offer your services to anyone

Private carriers may conduct operations under part 125 or 91.
