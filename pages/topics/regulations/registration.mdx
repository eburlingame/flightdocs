# Registration Certificate

Each aircraft is required to be registered with the FAA Aircraft Registry. The Certificate of Aircraft Registration is proof of
this registration and must be kept in the aircraft at all times.

Registration certificates expire **3 years** after being issued (to the last of the month they were issued).

If you have applied to renew your registration, the registration application must be carried in the aircraft as
proof of registration. This temporary registration is good for **90 days** after submitting the applications.
