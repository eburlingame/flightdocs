# Supplemental Type Certificate

A supplemental type certificate (STC) is a type certificate (TC) issued when the
FAA has approved a modification to an aeronautical product from its original
type-certificated design. The STC, which incorporates by reference the related
TC, approves not only the modification but also how that modification affects
the original design.

All applicable STCs should be kept as part of the aircraft maintenance logs.
