> No person may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft _carrying passengers_ unless that person has made at least 
3 takeoffs and 3 landings in the preceding **90** days.

> Similarly, no person may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers _at night\*_ unless the pilot 
has made 3 takeoffs and 3 landings **to a full stop** within the preceding **90** days.

These landings require:

- The pilot in question to be the sole manipulator of the controls
- Be in the same category, class, and type (if ia type rating is required)
- If a tailwheel aircraft is flown, the landings must be made to full stop

<Footnotes>
  * Night is defined as the period during the period beginning 1 hour after
  sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise
