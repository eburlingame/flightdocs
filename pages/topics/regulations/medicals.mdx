<Reg part="61.23" />

A higher-class medical can be used in place of a lower class one.

For example, suppose a pilot recieves a first-class medical certifiate:

- He or she can exercise the privlieges of the first class medical for one year following it's issuance
  - During this first year they can exercise the privleges of ATP, commerical, or private pilot
- After one year, the medical can be used in lieu of a third class medical (for private pilot operations, instructing, etc.)
  - The ceritifcate will remain valid for 4 more years (if under the age of 40)
  - Or, one more yeear (if over the age of 40), just as a 3rd class certificate would

See <Reg part="61.23(d)" /> for details.
