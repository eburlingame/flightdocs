# Commercial Pilot: Airplane

Outline based on the [commercial Pilot - Airplane: Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/media/commercial_airplane_acs_change_1.pdf)

## Preflight Preparation

### Pilot Qualifications

- [Certification requirements](/topics/commercial/requirements)
- [Recent flight experience](/topics/regulations/recent-experience)
- [Recordkeeping](/topics/regulations/record-keeping)
- [Privileges and limitations](/topics/commercial/privileges)
- [Medical certificates](/topics/regulations/medicals)
- Documents required to exercise commercial pilot privileges
- Part 68 BasicMed

### Airworthiness Requirements

- General airworthiness requirements and compliance for airplanes, including:
  - Certificate location and expiration dates
  - Required inspections and airplane logbook documentation
  - Airworthiness Directives and Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins
  - Purpose and procedure for obtaining a special flight permit
- Pilot-performed preventive maintenance.
- Equipment requirements for day and night VFR flight, to include:
  - Flying with inoperative equipment
  - Using an approved Minimum Equipment List (MEL)
  - Kinds of Operation Equipment List (KOEL)
  - Required discrepancy records or placards

### Weather Information

- Sources of weather data (e.g., National Weather Service, Flight Service) for flight planning purposes.
- Acceptable weather products and resources required for preflight planning, current and forecast weather for departure, en route, and arrival phases of flight.
- Meteorology applicable to the departure, en route, alternate, and destination under VFR in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) to include expected climate and hazardous conditions such as:
  - Atmospheric composition and stability
  - Wind (e.g., crosswind, tailwind, windshear, mountain wave, etc.)
  - Temperature
  - Moisture/precipitation
  - Weather system formation, including air masses and fronts
  - Clouds
  - Turbulence
  - Thunderstorms and microbursts
  - Icing and freezing level information
  - Fog/mist
  - Frost
  - Obstructions to visibility (e.g., smoke, haze, volcanic ash, etc.)
- Flight deck displays of digital weather and aeronautical information.

### Cross-Country Flight Planning

- Route planning, including consideration of different classes and special use airspace (SUA) and selection of appropriate and available navigation/communication systems and facilities.
- Altitude selection accounting for terrain and obstacles, glide distance of the airplane, VFR cruising altitudes, and the effect of wind.
- Calculating:
  - Time, climb and descent rates, course, distance, heading, true airspeed, and groundspeed
  - Estimated time of arrival to include conversion to universal coordinated time (UTC)
  - Fuel requirements, to include reserve
- Elements of a VFR flight plan.
- Procedures for activating and closing a VFR flight plan.

### National Airspace System

- Types of airspace/airspace classes and associated requirements and limitations.
- Charting symbology.
- Special use airspace (SUA), special flight rules areas (SFRA), temporary flight restrictions (TFR), and other airspace areas.

### Performance and Limitations

- Elements related to performance and limitations by explaining the use of charts, tables, and data to determine performance.
- Factors affecting performance, to include:
  - Atmospheric conditions
  - Pilot technique
  - Airplane configuration
  - Airport environment
  - Loading (e.g., center of gravity)
  - Weight and balance
- Aerodynamics

### Operation of Systems

- Airplane systems, to include:
  - Primary flight controls
  - Secondary flight controls
  - Powerplant and propeller
  - Landing gear
  - Fuel, oil, and hydraulic
