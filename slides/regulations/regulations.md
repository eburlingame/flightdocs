A Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) is an information tool that alerts, educates, and makes recommendations to the aviation community. This community includes air carrier certificate holders, fractional ownership.

Example:

- SAFO 25001: Risks Associated with Visual Approaches
- SAFO 24001: Boeing 737ED Exit door plugs

Find on the [FAA.gov SAFO page](https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/safo/all_safos)

## Information For Operators (InFOs)

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-2.png)

InFOs contain information for operators that help them meet certain administrative, regulatory, or operational requirements with low urgency or impact on safety.

Similar to SAFOs, but less urgent and not safety-related.

Find on the [FAA.gov InFOs page](https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/info/all_infos)
