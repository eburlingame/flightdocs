# Aerodynamics: Lift and Drag

---

## Objective

To understand basic aerodynamic concepts like lift, drag, and the nomenclature we use to describe it.

## Motivation

Forms foundational knowledge for more advanced aerodynamic topics and provides a useful mental model for pilots so they can better anticipate and understand the operation of an airplane.

## Newtons Laws of Motions

1. Objects in motion want to stay in motion
2. Fnet = mass \* acceleration
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

## Four Forces in Flight

Fnet = 0 for unaccelerated flight

## Lift Equation

$$
\text{lift} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S C_l}{2}
$$

$$
\text{Where:}\\
\rho = \text{air density}\\
V = \text{velocity}\\
S = \text{surface area}\\
C_l = \text{coefficient of lift}
$$
