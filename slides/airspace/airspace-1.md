# Airspace

## Lesson 1: Class Airspace and Identification

---

## Objective

Understand the purpose of the National Airspace System, the 5 classes of airspace, and how to identify the airspace that you are in.

## Motivation

Flying in the National Airspace System is an important component of flight planning and a consideration for almost every flight. A pilot needs to know what airspace they are in and what are the requirements for flying in each of the different kinds of airspace.

---

## Airspace Lesson Overview

Airspace is a large topic and can be difficult to understand intuitively. We'll cover topics in 4 lessons:

- Lesson 1: Class airspace, identification
- Lesson 2: Class airspace, entry requirements
- Lesson 3: Class airspace, weather minimums, speed limits, etc.
- Lesson 4: Special-use airspace

---

## Overview

- What is airspace?
- Why do we have airspace?
- Class Airspace
- Shape, size, identification of airspace classes
  - Class A
  - Class B
  - Class C
  - Class D
  - Class E
  - Class G
- Other Airspace

## What is airspace?

<div class="h-stack">

![h:400](images/image.png)

</div>

Airspace is a volume of the sky, defined with lateral and vertical boundaries, which has certain requirements for aircraft flying through it.

---

## Why do we have airspace?

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-1.png)

- Separation of airborne aircraft (especially VFR/IFR aircraft)
- Facilitates efficient flow of traffic
- Determine level of air traffic control services
- Protects facilities on the ground, or activities in the air

---

## Class Airspace

<div class="h-stack">

![h:350](images/image-2.png)

</div>

Airspace is divided into 5 class:

- Controlled Airspace: A, B, C, D, and E
- Uncontrolled Airspace: G

<!-- Class A: Most restrictive, Class G: least restrictive -->

---

- FL = Flight levels, thousands of feet
  - Used for altitude above 18,000' MSL
  - FL240 = 24,000' MSL

</div>
