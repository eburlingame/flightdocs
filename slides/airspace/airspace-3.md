# Airspace

## Lesson 3: Airspace Minimums

---

## Objective

Identify class airspace on a sectional chart, determine the airspace at a given point, and describe any weather, equipment, speed, or licensing requirements needed to operate within the airspace.

## Motivation

Each class of airspace has different weather minimums for VFR flight, equipment requirements, speed limits, and pilot qualification. A pilot will need to know and apply these rules before flying into any airspace.
