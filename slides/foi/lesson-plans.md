# Motivation & Objective

**Motivation:**  
Building upon the learning process to develop effective lesson objectives, lesson plans, and curriculum.

**Objective:**  
Understand appropriate and effective techniques for teaching and planning instructional sessions.

---

# Teaching: The Process

- Teaching = Organizing and presenting material for learner understanding
- Four basic steps:
  1. Preparation
  2. Presentation
  3. Application
  4. Assessment

---

# Teaching: Essential Skills

- **People skills:** Effective communication, listening
- **Subject matter expertise:** Deep knowledge of the subject
- **Management skills:** Planning, leading, organizing, supervising
- **Assessment skills:** Evaluating student progress

---

# Course of Training

- A curriculum or training plan for a specific goal (e.g., rating or certificate)
- Outlines the sequence and scope of instruction

---

# Preparation of a Lesson

- **Training objectives:** Define what the learner should achieve
- **Completion standards:** Criteria for successful performance

---

# Performance-Based Objectives

- Reasonable, measurable standards for judging learner progress
- Used to determine readiness to advance

---

# Decision-Based Objectives

- Evaluate judgment and risk management
- Used for complex topics (e.g., cross-country, emergencies, ADM)

---

# Importance of ACS in Aviation Training

- ACS/PTS provides specific content and criteria
- Instructors evaluate maneuvers using ACS standards in realistic scenarios
- Note ACS/PTS is an evaluation document, not a teaching document

---

# Organization of Material

- **Introduction:** Attention, motivation, overview
- **Development:** Chronological, simple-to-complex, known-to-unknown, most-to-least used
- **Conclusion:** Recap and wrap-up

---

# Training Delivery Methods

- **Lecture:** Good for background info, large groups; less interactive
- **Discussion:** Engages higher-order thinking, can be instructor- or learner-led
- **Guided Discussion:** Instructor steers with questions
- **Cooperative/Group Learning:** Small groups, active participation
- **Demonstration-Performance:** Instructor demonstrates, learner performs
- **Drill and Practice:** Repeated application for skill mastery

---

# Electronic Learning (e-Learning)

- **Advantages:** Flexible, low cost, updatable, self-paced
- **Disadvantages:** Less peer interaction, less personalized feedback

---

# Instructional Aids & Training Technologies

- **Characteristics:** Simple, clear, factual, support objectives
- **Reasons for use:** Hold attention, reduce barriers, speed instruction
- **Guidelines:** Plan ahead, support objectives, check for accuracy
- **Types:** Whiteboards, printed materials, videos, interactive systems, models

---

# Integrated Flight Instruction

- Combines flight maneuvers with real-world scenarios
- Develops both technical and decision-making skills

---

# Problem-Based Instruction

- Uses realistic, open-ended problems to motivate learning
- Encourages decision-making and critical thinking

---

# Planning Instructional Activity

- **Blocks of Learning:** Units that build on each other, sequenced for learner background
- **Training Syllabus:** Outline of blocks, flexible, includes objectives and risk management
- **Lesson Plans:** Written outlines for each instructional period, ensure coverage and efficiency

---

# Summary

- Effective teaching requires planning, organization, and a variety of methods
- Objectives and standards guide instruction
- Use appropriate delivery methods and aids
- Plan lessons and activities to build knowledge and skills progressively
