## Motivation & Objective

**Motivation:**  
Effective risk management is one of the most important skills a pilot needs to learn, understand, and practice as a habit.

**Objective:**  
Understand the responsibility of the instructor to mitigate risks associated with teaching, and teach students to evaluate risk systematically.

---

## Teaching Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation

- Teach students to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate risks.
- Use structured tools and checklists to guide the process.
- Emphasize evaluating both severity (impact) and likelihood (probability) of risks.

---

## Risk Management Tools

### PAVE Checklist

- **P**ilot: Experience, health, currency (use IMSAFE)
- **A**ircraft: Airworthiness, equipment, limitations
- **V**ironment: Weather, terrain, airspace, airports
- **E**xternal Pressures: Schedules, expectations, distractions

Encourage use of the PAVE checklist before every flight to identify risk factors.

---

### Flight Risk Assessment Tools (FRATs)

- Structured forms or digital tools to quantify risk before a flight.
- Assigns scores to various risk factors (pilot, aircraft, environment, external pressures).
- Helps decide if risk is acceptable, needs mitigation, or flight should be cancelled.

---

## When and How to Introduce Risk Management

- Begin risk management instruction at the start of training, including ground lessons.
- Reinforce during preflight planning and post-flight debriefs.
- Integrate risk management into every lesson, not just as a one-time topic.

---

## Risk Management by Phase of Instruction

- **Pre-solo:** Instructor leads risk analysis, discusses before/after each flight.
- **Pre-solo cross-country:** Learner performs risk analysis with coaching.
- **Cross-country training:** Focus on complex, real-world risk scenarios.
- **Instrument/transition/recurrent:** Address unique risks (e.g., IFR, new aircraft).

---

## Managing Risk During Flight Instruction

- **Pilot risks:** Expect learner mistakes; maintain margin for error. Instructor must be current and proficient.
- **Aircraft risks:** Ensure airworthiness, be aware of maintenance limitations.
- **Environment risks:** Crowded airspace, weather, terrain, night operations.
- **External pressures:** Distractions, pressure to complete training, scheduling.

---

## Best Practices for Managing Risk

- Use IMSAFE checklist for pilot fitness.
- Involve learners in risk assessment and mitigation.
- Be willing to switch to ground lessons if conditions are unsafe.
- Address maintenance issues before preflight.
- Maintain vigilance for changing conditions.

---

## Special Considerations: Takeoffs & Landings

### Takeoffs

- Limited time for instruction—brief thoroughly beforehand.
- Maintain a sterile cockpit.
- Create realistic but safe scenarios.

### Landings

- Complex: power, control, wind, configuration.
- Use concise prompts.
- Be familiar with local airports and conditions.

---

## Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM) & CRM/SRM

- Teach ADM models for systematic decision-making.
- Use Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM) as appropriate.
- Emphasize communication, workload management, and resource use.

---

## Hazards in Flight Instruction

- Unique hazards: dual controls, divided attention, unfamiliar aircraft.
- Instructor must maintain situational awareness and be ready to intervene.

---

## Obstacles to Situational Awareness

- Distractions from instruction tasks.
- Fatigue, stress, or overconfidence.
- Environmental factors (weather, airspace complexity).

---

## Human Factors & Hazardous Attitudes

- Recognize hazardous attitudes (anti-authority, impulsivity, invulnerability, macho, resignation).
- Teach strategies to counteract these attitudes.
- Monitor both instructor and learner for signs of hazardous thinking.

---

## Scenario-Based Training (SBT)

- Use realistic scenarios to teach and assess risk management and ADM.
- Scenarios should be relevant to the learner’s experience and training phase.
- Debrief scenarios to reinforce lessons learned.

---

## Maintaining Awareness and Oversight

- Continuous supervision of learner’s actions.
- Monitor learner’s cognitive and physiological state (anxiety, fatigue).
- Maintain overall situational awareness of aircraft and environment.

---

## Modeling and Teaching Safety Practices

- Collision avoidance while instructing.
- Avoid unnecessary distractions.
- Maintain coordinated flight.
- Use positive exchange of flight controls.
- Continuous awareness of aircraft’s state and position in the NAS.

---

## Risk Matrix

- Evaluate risk by severity and likelihood.
- Use the matrix to guide mitigation decisions.

---

## Summary

- Risk management is a core instructional responsibility.
- Use structured tools (PAVE, FRAT, IMSAFE) and techniques.
- Integrate risk management into all phases of training.
- Model and reinforce safe practices at all times.
- Use scenario-based training to develop real-world risk management skills.
