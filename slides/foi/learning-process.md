# The Learning Process

--

## Objective

Understand the learning process and apply the information to provide effective instruction.

## Motivation

An effective instructor uses knowledge of the learning process to structure training and critique students.

---

## Overview

- Definitions of learning
- Learning theories (Behaviorism, Cognitive)
- Perceptions and insight
- Levels and laws of learning
- Domains of learning
- Scenario-based training
- Acquiring skill knowledge and practice types
- Evaluation, critique, and error management
- Memory, retention, and forgetting
- Transfer of learning

---

# Definitions of Learning

- A process resulting in a change in behavior.
- Gaining knowledge or skills through study, instruction, or experience.

---

# Learning Theory in Instruction

## Behaviorism

- Behavior explained as observable responses to stimuli.
- Human behavior is conditioned by environmental events.
- "Carrot-and-stick" approach.

---

## Cognitive Theory

- Focuses on internal mental processes.
- Involves reflection, problem-solving, and critical thinking.

---

# Perceptions and Insight

- Perceptions are the basis for learning.
- Learning maps new sensory input into useful information.
- Insight: Grouping perceptions into meaningful wholes.
- Instructors guide learners to synthesize perceptions into insights.

---

# Acquiring Knowledge

## Levels of Learning

- **Rote:** Memorization, first attempt.
- **Understanding:** Making associations, building mental models.
- **Application:** Using knowledge meaningfully.
- **Correlation:** Generalizing concepts, forming schemas.

---

# Laws of Learning

- **Readiness:** Student must be motivated and ready.
- **Exercise:** Practice is essential.
- **Effect:** Positive experiences reinforce learning.
- **Primacy:** First-learned is best remembered.
- **Intensity:** Vivid experiences are retained better.
- **Recency:** Most recent information is remembered best.

---

# Laws of Learning – Example

**Intensity:**
A flight instructor random simulates an engine failure during a training flight when the student is not expecting it. The vivid, realistic scenario helps the student remember emergency procedures better than a simple lecture.

**Recency:**
Reviewing short-field landing procedures right before a flight increases the chance the student will recall and apply them during the lesson.

---

# Domains of Learning

- **Cognitive:** Recall, understanding, application.
- **Affective:** Attitudes, emotions, values.
- **Psychomotor:** Physical skills, habits.

---

# Domains of Learning – Example

**Cognitive:**
A student recalls the steps for a preflight inspection.

**Affective:**
A student develops a positive attitude toward safety after hearing accident case studies.

**Psychomotor:**
A student practices and refines the physical skill of holding a steady heading during straight-and-level flight.

---

# Characteristics of Learning

- **Purposeful:** Learners seek relevance.
- **Result of Experience:** Built from prior experiences.
- **Multifaceted:** Involves many elements, not always intended.
- **Active Process:** Requires continuous engagement.

---

# Scenario-Based Training (SBT)

- Uses real-world scenarios to meet training objectives.
- Helps students apply past experiences and strengthen decision-making.

---

# Acquiring Skill Knowledge

## Stages

1. **Cognitive:** Learning facts, initial attempts.
2. **Associative:** Practice, self-assessment.
3. **Automatic Response:** Skill becomes smooth and automatic.

---

## Knowledge of Results

- Feedback should be early and frequent.
- Students should learn to judge their own performance.

---

## How to Develop Skills

- Repeated, focused practice transitions skills from effortful to automatic.
- Early attempts are often awkward and slow.

---

## Learning Plateaus

- May result from consolidation, waning interest, or cognitive limits.
- May require new practice methods to overcome.

---

# Types of Practice

- **Deliberate:** Goal-oriented, with feedback.
- **Blocked:** Repetitive, short-term memory.
- **Random:** Varies tasks, best for long-term retention.

---

# Types of Practice – Example

**Deliberate Practice:**
A student practices crosswind landings with the instructor providing immediate feedback on each approach.

**Blocked Practice:**
A student performs ten consecutive power-off stalls in one session.

**Random Practice:**
A student alternates between steep turns, slow flight, and stalls in a random order during a single lesson.

---

# Evaluation vs Critique

- Critique provides suggestions early in training.
- Over-learning: Continued study after proficiency.
- Learners must know when and how to apply skills, not just perform them.

---

# Distractions, Interruptions, Fixation, Inattention

- Minimize distractions early; introduce as students progress.
- Fixation: Over/under-focusing on information.
- Inattention: Missing important cues.

---

# Errors

- **Slip:** Right intention, wrong action.
- **Mistake:** Wrong intention.
- Minimize errors by taking time, using checklists, developing routines, and raising awareness.
- Instructors should help students recover and learn from errors.

---

# Errors – Example

**Slip:**
A student intends to lower the landing gear but accidentally retracts the flaps.

**Mistake:**
A student believes the traffic pattern altitude is 1,000 feet AGL at all airports, but at a specific airport, it is 800 feet AGL.

**Minimizing Errors:**
The instructor encourages the use of checklists and routines, and discusses common errors before each flight.

---

# Memory

## Sensory Memory

- Receives initial stimuli, filters for importance.

## Short-Term Memory (STM)

- Holds info for ~30 seconds, limited capacity.
- Chunking and rehearsal help transfer to long-term.

## Long-Term Memory (LTM)

- Permanent, infinite storage.
- Recall involves reconstructing information.

---

## How Usage Affects Memory

- Repetition and meaningful association improve retention.
- Deeper thinking leads to better memory.

---

## Forgetting

- **Fading:** Unused info is lost.
- **Retrieval Failure:** "Tip of the tongue" forgetting
- **Interference:** Similar info causes confusion.
- **Suppression:** Subconscious blocking.

---

# Retention of Learning

- Praise and positive attitudes aid memory.
- Association and repetition help recall.
- Learning with all senses is most effective.
- Use mnemonics.

---

# Transfer of Learning – Example

**Near Transfer:**
A student who has learned to land a Cessna 172 applies the same landing technique to a Cessna 182.

**Far Transfer:**
A student uses decision-making skills learned in flight training to handle an unexpected situation while driving a car.

**Positive Transfer:**
Learning to use a checklist in ground training helps the student use it effectively in the cockpit.

**Negative Transfer:**
A student accustomed to pushing a throttle forward for more power in one aircraft accidentally pulls it back in a different aircraft with a reverse throttle configuration.

---

# Transfer of Learning

- Applying knowledge to new situations.
- **Near Transfer:** Similar contexts.
- **Far Transfer:** Different contexts, shared structure.
- **Positive Transfer:** Previous learning helps.
- **Negative Transfer:** Previous learning interferes.
- Encourage good habits, deep understanding, and continued practice.
