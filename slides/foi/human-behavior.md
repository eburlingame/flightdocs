## Elements of Human Behavior

---

#### Definitions of Human Behavior

- Human behavior: The result of attempts to satisfy certain needs.
- Encompasses actions, thoughts, and feelings.
- Influenced by environment, experience, and individual differences.

---

#### Instructor and Learner Relationship

- Mutual respect and trust are essential.
- Instructors set the tone for learning.
- Positive relationships foster motivation and openness.
- You will teach all sorts of people with different personalities.
- Be aware of how your teaching style is compatible (or incompatible) with a students learning style

---

#### Motivation

- **Theory X:** People are inherently lazy and avoid work.
- **Theory Y:** Work is as natural as play and rest, given proper motivation.
- Motivations can be positive or negative:
  - Negative motivation can be the result of fear.
  - Positive motivation is provided by the promise or achievement of rewards like financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept, personal gain, or public recognition.
  - _Positive_ motivation is essential to true learning.

---

#### Maintaining Motivation

- Give praise during incremental successes in training.
- "Challenge" the student to continue getting better.
- Training plateaus are to be expected.
- Emphasize what you can do with aviation.
- Play down the negatives when appropriate.
- Utilize a pre-lesson evaluation of readiness:
  - Do your best to verify whether the learner is physically and mentally ready to learn.

---

#### Human Needs

Abraham Maslow studied human needs and motivation, discovering that certain needs take precedent over others.

- Learners tend to show little to no motivation or attention if most of their needs are not met:
  - If a student is hungry, they will focus on that instead of a lesson.
  - If a student feels unsafe, they will be distracted by a flight response.
- Maslow’s Hierarchy (from most basic to highest):
  1. Physiological (food, water)
  2. Security (safety, stability)
  3. Belonging (social, acceptance)
  4. Esteem (confidence, respect)
  5. Cognitive and Aesthetic (knowledge, beauty)
  6. Self-actualization (achieving potential)

---

#### Defense Mechanisms

Unconscious strategies to protect from anxiety or unacceptable thoughts.

- **Repression**: Placing uncomfortable thoughts in an inaccessible area of the mind
- **Denial**: Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening
- **Compensation**: Emphasizing strengths in other areas to distract from or disguise a weakness
- **Projection**: Projecting the blame of a personal failing onto someone else
- **Rationalization**: Justifying poor performance on external factors outside of their control
- **Fantasy**: Daydreams about how thing should be or will be in the future, ignoring the current reality
- **Displacement**: Redirecting anger or frustration to someone or something else

---

## Learner Emotional Reactions

- Anxiety and stress
- Impatience
- Worry or lack of interest
- Physical discomfort, illness, fatigue, and dehydration
- Apathy due to inadequate instruction

---

#### Anxiety and Stress

- Anxiety is a normal emotion for new pilot learners
- Can be minimized by making the experience pleasurable and introducing topics with care
- Example: Performing stalls with a limited drop of the nose

---

#### Impatience

- Can be a large deterrent to student success
- Often learns only seek the objective, not the training steps taken to get there
- Train one step at a time
- Train at a pace appropriate for the learner, not too fast/too slow

---

#### Worry or Lack of Interest

- Learners who are worried or emotionally upset are not ready to learn
- Use the learner's enthusiasm and interests to get them engaged, and divert attention from worries and troubles

---

## Physical Discomfort, Illness, Fatigue, and Dehydration

- Any physical discomfort greatly affects the ability of a student to learn.
- The first signs of dehydration is fatigue.
- Always carry an ample supply of water, and drink frequently.
- End a flight as soon as air sickness symptoms are experienced.

### Fatigue

- Fatigue can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).
- Acute fatigue accumulates as mental effort is utilized.
- Only continue lessons if the learner is alert and performing at an expected level.
- Acute fatigue can be indicated by:
  - Inattention
  - Distractibility
  - Errors in timing
  - Lack of awareness
  - Irritability
- Chronic fatigue may have deep-seated origins and requires a prolonged and deliberate solution.

---

### Reactions to Stress

- Stress will cause a fight or flight response in the body.
- **Normal reactions to stress:**
  - Normal individuals respond rapidly and exactly.
  - They will utilize their training and experience.
- **Abnormal reactions to stress:**
  - Inappropriate response to actions, like over-elation.
  - Extreme over-cooperation.
  - Painstaking self-control.
  - Big changes in mood from lesson-to-lesson.
  - Severe anger towards an instructor.

---

#### Apathy Due to Inadequate Instruction

- Poor instruction leads to disengagement and lack of motivation
- Instructors must be prepared, enthusiastic, and responsive

---

## Teaching the Adult Learner

- Adults have certain expectations about what it takes to learn and succeed:
  - Adults are autonomous and self-directed.
  - Bring life experience to learning.
  - Goal-oriented and relevancy-oriented.
  - Need to see the practical relevance of presented material.
  - Need to feel independent and in-control.
  - Want to maintain their self-esteem and self-image.
  - Adults want to solve problems.
  - May have different constraints than younger learners.
- Instructors should:
  - Provide a clear training syllabus.
  - Clarify and articulate all learner expectations early on.
  - Refrain from “spoon-feeding” the learner.
  - Create opportunities for mutual planning.

---

## Effective Communication

---

#### Basic Elements of Communication

- Source (sender, teacher, speaker)
- Symbols (words, gestures, signs, props)
- Receiver (learner, student)
- Feedback (response)
- Channel (medium for communication)

---

#### Barriers to Effective Communication

- Lack of common experience
- Confusion between symbol and symbolized object
- Overuse of abstractions
- Interference (physical, psychological)

---

#### Developing Communication Skills

- Role playing
  - Practice instructional communication with someone other than a student.
- Listening
  - Do not interrupt
  - Do not judge
  - Think before answering
  - Be close enough to hear
  - Watch nonverbal cues
  - Beware of biases
  - Look for underlying feeling
  - Concentrate
  - Don't rehearse answers while listening
  - Do not insist on the last word
- Questioning
  - Open-ended questions are good for large concepts.
  - Closed-ended questions are good when you want a specific answer.
  - Paraphrasing an answer back to the learner can be helpful.
- Explaining clearly
- Providing feedback
- Adapting to learner needs
- Instruction enhancement
  - Always keep learning as an instructor.

---

## Recognizing & Accommodating Human Behavior

- Observe learner cues (verbal & nonverbal)
- Adjust instruction to meet needs
- Foster a positive, inclusive environment

---

## Barriers to Communication

- Lack of common experience
  - Communication can only be effective when there are experiences that are similar to what is being described
  - The learner's experience determines how they interpret symbols
  - For example, using aviation terminology before the learner has learned the vocabulary
- Confusion between the symbol and the object
  - Misunderstanding between a symbol that the listener interprets and the one intended by the speaker

---

## Barriers to Communication

- Overuse of abstractions
  - Using words are concepts that are too general
  - For example, "aircraft" could be a helicopter, airplane, airship
- Interference
  - Somehow the message is cut short or disrupted, but the listener isn't aware
- External factors
  - Difficulty hearing, external pressures, external pressures, multitasking

---

## Developing Communication Skills

- Role playing
- Listening
  - Do not interrupt
  - Do not judge

# Summary

- Understanding human behavior is key to effective instruction.
- Recognize and address emotional and physical barriers.
- Communicate clearly and adapt to each learner.
- Foster motivation and a positive learning environment.
