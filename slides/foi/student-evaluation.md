# Motivation & Objective

**Motivation:**  
Assessment is an integral component of student instruction.

**Objective:**  
Understand and apply the strategies for effective student evaluation and assessment.

---

# Purpose and Characteristics of Effective Assessment

- **Purpose:**
  Assess learning progress and provide feedback to both learner and instructor.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Objective: Free from bias, honest
  - Flexible: Adapted to the situation
  - Acceptable: Learner understands the reason for assessment
  - Comprehensive: Covers all necessary areas
  - Constructive: Includes praise where appropriate
  - Thoughtful: Respects learner's feelings
  - Specific: Provides actionable feedback

---

## Example: Effective Assessment

- An instructor observes a student performing a preflight inspection.
- The instructor provides specific feedback:
  "You checked the fuel visually and by draining the sumps—great job being thorough. Next time, also check the fuel cap is secure before moving on."
- The feedback is objective, specific, and constructive.

---

# Traditional Assessments

- Generally written tests (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank)
- Usually time-limited

**Good written tests should be:**

- Reliable: Consistent results across students/graders
- Valid: Measures intended objectives
- Usable: Easy to read and complete
- Objective: Single, clear scoring
- Comprehensive: Covers required learning
- Discriminating: Differentiates performance quality

---

## Example: Traditional Assessment

- **Multiple Choice:**
  "What is the minimum safe altitude over a congested area?"
- **True/False:**
  "The pitot tube is used to measure static pressure. (False)"
- **Fill-in-the-blank:**
  "The four forces of flight are lift, **\_**, thrust, and drag."

---

# Authentic Assessments

- Involves real-world tasks and demonstration of skills
- Focuses on application, not just recall

---

## Learner-Centered Assessment

A four-step self-assessment process:

1. **Replay:** Learner recounts the activity; instructor clarifies as needed
2. **Reconstruct:** Learner identifies what could have been done differently
3. **Reflect:** Learner finds meaning in the experience
4. **Redirect:** Learner considers how to apply lessons in the future

---

## Example: Learner-Centered Assessment

- **Scenario:** After a crosswind landing, the instructor asks:
  - "Walk me through your approach and landing. What went well? What would you do differently next time?"
  - The student reflects: "I flared a bit high. Next time, I'll focus on my sight picture and use more right rudder."

---

## Maneuver or Procedure Grades

Levels of performance:

1. **Describe:** Can describe, but needs help to perform
2. **Explain:** Understands, but still needs help to perform
3. **Practice:** Can execute with some coaching/correction
4. **Perform:** Can perform independently

---

## Example: Maneuver Grade

- **Steep Turns:**
  - **Describe:** "I know I need to bank 45°, but I'm not sure how to maintain altitude."
  - **Explain:** "I understand I need to add back pressure and adjust power, but I need reminders."
  - **Practice:** "I can do the turn, but sometimes lose altitude—occasional coaching helps."
  - **Perform:** "I consistently maintain altitude and bank angle without help."

---

## Assessing Risk Management Skills

Levels of risk management:

1. **Explain:** Identifies and understands risks, needs prompting for decisions
2. **Practice:** Applies SRM principles with some coaching, active decision-maker
3. **Manage/Decide:** Gathers information and makes autonomous decisions

---

## Example: Risk Management Assessment

- **Weather Decision:**
  - **Explain:** "I know thunderstorms are forecast, but I'm not sure if we should go."
  - **Practice:** "I check radar and suggest a delay, but ask the instructor for confirmation."
  - **Manage/Decide:** "I review weather, decide to delay departure, and brief the instructor on my decision."

---

# Choosing an Effective Assessment Method

1. Determine the level of learning to be assessed
2. List indicators of desired behaviors
3. Establish performance-based objectives
4. Develop test items or activities targeting those objectives

---

# Purposes and Types of Critiques

- **Purpose:** Provide feedback and promote learning through evaluation

**Types:**

- Instructor/learner critique
- Learner-led critique
- Small group critique
- Self-critique
- Written critique

---

# Oral Assessment

- Direct questioning by the instructor

---

## Example: Oral Assessment

- **Fact Question:**
  "What is the purpose of the mixture control?"
- **HOTS Question:**
  "How would you handle an engine failure after takeoff?"
- **Follow-up:**
  Instructor adapts questions to the student's experience and responses.

---

## Characteristics of Effective Questions

- Written in advance
- Can be factual (rote) or higher-order (HOTS)
- Should be:
  1. Relevant to the subject
  2. Brief, clear, and definite
  3. Adapted to learner's experience
  4. Focused on one idea
  5. Challenging

---

## Types of Questions to Avoid

- Bewildering questions
- Oversized questions
- Toss-up questions
- Trick questions
- Irrelevant questions

---

## Answering Learner Questions

- Think before answering
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity
- After answering, check learner's understanding

---

# Assessment of Piloting Ability

- Evaluate both technical and decision-making skills
- Use a combination of traditional and authentic assessments
- Provide specific, actionable feedback for improvement

---

# Summary

- Assessment is essential for learning and instruction
- Use both traditional and authentic methods
- Choose assessment methods based on objectives and learner needs
- Provide clear, constructive feedback
- Effective questioning and critique enhance learning
