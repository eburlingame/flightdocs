# Pilot Qualifications

---

## Objective

Just as we determine the airworthiness of the airplane, we need to evaluate the pilot's qualifications to fly legally and safely.

## Motivation

All pilots need to understand their legal requirements before piloting an aircraft.

- Currency: Legal to fly
  - 90-day currency
  - Current flight review
  - Current medical
- Proficiency: Safe and competent
  - Have you flown recently?
  - Have you flown with an instructor recently?
  - What kind of flying have you done?

## Establishing Personal Minimums

- Come up with your own set of hard requirements for when you will fly vs not fly:
  - X knots of crosswind
  - X knots of gust factor
  - Fly for 6 months without an instructor
  - After work
- Write down these minimums and hold yourself to them
  - As you gain more training and experience, you can increase these

Are you able to fly at night with a sport pilot certificate? How about a recreational pilot certificate?

---

# Knowledge Check

You completed a flight review on September 4th, 2025. When will you be due for another flight review?
