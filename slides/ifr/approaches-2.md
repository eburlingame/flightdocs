## Getting Established on an Approach

<div class="h-stack">

<div>

How do we get from the enroute phase to the final approach phase?

- **Direct to an IAF** (e.g. LOATH)
  - Or an IF if RNAV equipped
- **Via a feeder route** (e.g. COUGA)
- **Vectors to final**
  - ATC-assigned headings, intercept to the final approach course
  - Entry behind the FAF

A published 180-degree turn to align you with the final approach course.

- Types of turns, up to the pilot what to use
  - 45/180
  - 80/260
  - Teardrop
  - Racetrack
- Protected turn area, "Remain within 10NM"
- Descend to lower altitude after established inbound

# Approach Types

- Precision
- Non-precision
- GPS Approaches

---

## Precision Approaches

Precision approaches are characterized by **vertical and horizontal guidance** that position the aircraft close to the runway from where it can safely land.

Type of precision approaches:

- **PAR** - Precision approach radar
- **GLS** - GBAS landing system
- **ILS** - Instrument landing system

**ILS typically have minimums of 200 feet above TDZE**

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, 5-4-11, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Components of an ILS

<div class="h-stack">

![w:850](images/image-6.png)

<div>

**Localizer:**

- Positioned at the end of the runway
- Angular width is 700' wide at the threshold
  - Two signals: 150HZ and 90HZ signals
- Gives precise L/R angular guidance aligned with the runway
- Note: Sensitivity depends on runway length

<div class="references">AIM 1-1-9, IFH Ch 10</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## Components of an ILS

<div class="h-stack">

![w:900](images/image-31.png)

<div>

**Glideslope:**

- Positioned to the side of the runway
- Gives angular vertical guidance, usually a 3Â° glideslope
- Gets more sensitive as we get closer to the runway
- Note: There can be interference on the glideslope signal which can cause "false" glideslopes

<div class="references">AIM 1-1-9</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## ILS Marker Beacons

<div class="h-stack">

<div>

Used to be standard on an ILS. They were identified with a tone and light on the audio panel.

- **Outer marker:** FAF ([tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW8IF9WdoD0))
- **Middle marker:** Standard minimums ([tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSdlsB5NSsw))
- **Inner marker:** Used to identify lower minimums of CAT II or III ILS ([tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYit3zKbZkw))

We now use DME, 2nd VOR, or GPS to identify these points

</div>

<div>

## Capturing an ILS

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-9.png)

![alt text](images/image-35.png)

</div>

- Glideslope [needle starts above us](https://www.luizmonteiro.com/Learning_VOR_Sim.aspx)
- As we approach the GS intercept (lightning bolt), glideslope needle will come down
- One dot below glideslope: Reconfigure for your approach

<div class="references">IFH Ch 9</div>

---

## Rule of Thumb for a 3&deg; Descent

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-36.png)

Descent rate = (Ground speed in knots) / 2 \* 10

90 knots / 2 \* 10 = 450 fpm

How would wind affect our descent rate?

---

## Flying an ILS

<div class="h-stack">

![w:800](images/image-8.png)

<div>

Fly to keep the needles centered

- GS needle moves up: Too low
- GS needle moves down: Too high
- LOC needle moves left: Right of course
- LOC needle moves right: Left of course

Both needles get more sensitive as we get closer to the runway.

</div>

</div>

<div class="references">IFH Ch 8</div>

---

## Precision Approaches Minimums

<div class="h-stack">

![w:2000](images/image-10.png)

- We fly our glideslope and localizer until the **Decision Altitude**
- DA is listed in MSL altitude., along with required flight visibility
  - E.g. 398 ft MSL, 1/2 s.m. vis.
- At the D.A. we can continue our descent if we have the required visibility and have the runway envionment in sight
  - More on this

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-20, 14 CFR 91.175</div>

---

## When Can We Land? - FAR 91.175

An aircraft may not descend from the DA/MDA unless:

1. Aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing can be made on the intended runway
2. The descent can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers
3. For 121/135 ops: A descent that allows for touchdown in the touchdown zone
4. The **flight visibility** must be greater than prescribed on the chart
5. At least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is visible

## Non-Precision Approaches

Non-precision approaches are characterized by **step-down fixes** and a **minimum descent altitude (MDA)** .

**Types:**

- **VOR** - VOR approach
- **TACAN** - TACAN approach
- **LOC** - Localizer approach
- **LDA** - Localizer directional aid
- **LOC BC** - Localizer back course approach
- **ASR** - Approach surveillance radar

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Flying a Non-Precision Approach

<div class="h-stack">

<div class="h-stack">

![w:600](images/image-12.png)

</div>

- Use the primary navaid for L/R guidance
- Descent to the lowest altitude for each segment based on the profile view
- After the final step-down fix, descend to the approariate MDA
- Fly at the MDA until
  - The runway is in sight and a landing can be made (91.175)
  - Or, the missed approach point and execute the missed procedure

</div>

## Flying VOR Approaches with RNAV

**AIM 1-2-3:** "Use of a suitable RNAV system as a means to navigate on the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure based on VOR, TACAN or NDB signal is allowable."

**Requirements:**

- The underlying NAVAID must be operational
- The NAVAID must be monitored for the final approach course alignment
- Secondary CDI or bearing pointer should monitor the underlying NAVAID
- Guidance can be used from the GPS

## RNAV (GPS) Approaches

![alt text](images/image-13.png)

<div class="h-stack">

<div class="flex-2">

**Approaches with Vertical Guidance:**

- **LPV**: Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance
- **LNAV/VNAV**: Lateral/vertical navigation

</div>

<div class="flex-1">

**Without Vertical Guidance:**

- **LP** - Akin to a LOC approach
- **LNAV** - Lateral guidance

</div>

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## LPV Approaches: Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance

<div class="h-stack">

- **ILS-like minimums** (200' minima)
- Flown just like an ILS:
  - Intercept the "localizer"
  - Capture the glideslope from below
- Gives angular L/R guidance which gets more sensitive as you descend
- **Not technically a "precision approach"** (for the purposes of alternate planning)

![w:800](images/image-14.png)

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## LPV Approach CDI Sensitivity

<div class="h-stack">

![w:700](images/image-15.png)

</div>

- CDI sensitivity becomes more accurate as you get closer to the runway
- Final segment has angular guidance like an ILS

<div class="references">IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## LNAV/VNAV Lateral/vertical Approaches

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-16.png)

- Final approach has **fixed 0.3NM sensitivity** (not angular like LPV)
- Doesn't require a WAAS-based navigator
- These were initially designed for baro-aided FMS systems
- Garmin annunciation: Garmin L/VNAV

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## GPS Mode Annunications

<div class="h-stack">

![w:900](images/image-17.png)

- **ENR**: Enroute
- **TERM**: Terminal
- **LNAV**: Lateral navigation
- **LNAV +V**: Lateral navigation w/ advisory vertical guidance
- **LP**: Localizer performance
- **LP +V**: Localizer performance w/ advisory vertical guidance

</div>

<div class="references">IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Advisory Vertical Guidance

![bg left:60% fit](images/image-18.png)

**LP+V, LNAV+V**

A glideslope generated the navigator which meets the crossing requirements of the step-down fixes of a non-precision approach.

Follow the guidance to the **MDA** (not a DA).

<div class="references">IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Circling Approaches

Allow you to fly an approach to one runway, but "circle" to land on a different runway

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-19.png)

- This requires **higher minimums** to ensure obstacle clearance
- Should maneuver to the "shortest path to the base or downwind leg"
- **Missed approach procedure:**
  - Climbing turn towards the runway, the execute missed turn procedure
  - Additional turns in the protected area may be required

</div>

---

## Circling Approach Minimums

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-20.png)

<div class="v-stack">

![alt text](images/image-21.png)

![alt text](images/image-22.png)

**Expanded circling protections:** Introduced in 2012, indicated by negative C on minima line

</div>

</div>

---

## Sidestep Maneuver

<div class="h-stack">

![w:900](images/image-30.png)

<div>

- Parallel runways less than 1200 ft. apart
- ATC can say "cleared ILS runway 20R approach, side-step runway 20L"
- **Commence the side-step maneuver as soon as possible** after the runway or runway environment is in sight

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-19</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## LDA - Localizer Directional Aid Approaches

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](<images/lda approach.png>)

- Localizer (and sometimes glideslope) which provide approach guidance **not aligned with a runway**
- Example: KDLS LDA/DME RWY 25
- They are **non-precision approaches**, even if they had a glideslope
- **S-LDA minimums are treated as an MDA**

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Localizer Backcourse Approaches - LOC BC

<div class="h-stack">

![w:500](images/image-23.png)

<div>

The signal from a localizer also extends behind the primary runway, and can be used to guidance to the opposing runway.

- Disregard any glideslope indication
- A standard CDI will be read L/R backwards
  - Fly away from the needle instead of towards it
  - ["You are the needle"](https://www.luizmonteiro.com/Learning_VOR_Sim.aspx)
- With an HSI, set the **inbound/front course** into your OBS
  - Then the green needles will read correctly (since the needles are flipped upside down)

</div>

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Example LOC BC Approach - KSLE LOC BC RWY 13

![bg right:50% fit](images/image-32.png)

---

## Visual and Contact Approaches

<div class="h-stack">

![w:800](images/image-24.png)

<div>

**Visual Approaches:**

- If the airport has VFR weather (1000 + 3), controllers can assign a visual approach
- We're still IFR, so VFR cloud clearance rules (91.255) don't apply
- Expectation that we land visually, traffic + terrain clearance is our responsbility

**Charted Visual Procedures:**

- These are uncommon
- Often used for noise-abatement

<div class="references">AIM 5-5-11, 5-4-23</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## Contact Approaches

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-25.png)

- Gives us permission to descend to and land visually
- Need flight visibility of >1 s.m. and need to remain clear of clouds
- **Pilot needs to ask for a contact approach**

</div>

Note that these would only be used if the conditions are less than VFR at the airport, so we'd be maneuver at low altitude for the airport in &lt;3 s.m. conditions

<div class="references">AIM 4-4-12, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Inoperative Equipment - Navigation

<div class="h-stack">

<div>

**Primary navaid failure (VOR, LOC):**

- Before the FAF: Notify ATC and choose a different approach, or divert
- After the FAF: Execute missed approach procedure

**Glideslope failure:**

- **Outside the FAF:** Inform ATC, ask for the localizer approach
- **Inside the FAF:** "Fail-down" to the LOC approach, follow LOC guidance and climb/descend to the MDA

</div>

<div>

![w:1200](images/image-26.png)

<div class="references">AIM 1-1-9</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## Inoperative Equipment - Visual Aids

<div class="h-stack">

![w:1000](images/image-27.png)

<div>

**Approach lighting system inoperative:**

- **Higher minimums are required** with inoperative ALS
- If more than one component is inoperative, each minimum is raised to the **highest minimum** required by any single inoperative component
- See **Inoperative Components or Visual Aids Table**

</div>

</div>

<div class="references">AIM 5-4-5, IFH Ch 10</div>

---

## Cold Weather Operations

<div class="h-stack">

![alt text](images/image-28.png)

</div>

- The snowflake symbol on an approach indicates cold-weather corrections are required when the reported temperature is at or below the given value
- Raise any cross-altitude restrictions and minimum altitude by the amount in the cold-weather correction chart in the TPP

<div class="h-stack">

## Knowledge Check

While breifing an approach chart you come across a symbol on the airport sketch that you don't recognize. Where can you find its meaning?

---

## Knowledge Check

When flying a localizer back-course approach you notice the glideslope needle falling. What should you do?

---

## Knowledge Check

While circling to land to the opposing runway you lose sight of the airfield. You're currently at 600 feet AGL and abeam the mid point of the runway. How should initiate the missed approach procedure?

---

## Knowledge Check

You're approaching an airport to land and you notice that the VOR navaid on the field is out-of-service. You were hoping to fly the VOR-16 approach to land. You have a WAAS-based GPS system installed in your airplane. Can you fly the approach?
