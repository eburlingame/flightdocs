# Airport Operations

---

## Hazards Operating Near An Airport

- Traffic congestion
- Climbing/descending aircraft
- Pilot preoccupation

---

## Runway Identifiers

![bg left:40% contain](images/image-1.png)

- Aligned with magnetic north heading
- Example: Heading 140&deg;M gives runway 14
- Shift slowly over time
- Parallel runways will be given L, R, or C designations

---

## What is a traffic pattern?

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-2.png)

- Standardized rectangle aircraft fly around a given runway

---

## Traffic Pattern Altitude

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field.jpeg>)

- Chart supplement
- Propeller-driven aircraft: 1000' above field elevation
- Large or turbine aircraft: 1500' above field elevation
- Helicopters: 500', but may vary

---

## Traffic Pattern Direction

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field 2.jpeg>)

- Shown in chart supplement, sectional ("RP 36"), and ForeFlight
- If not shown, left traffic is implied

---

## Traffic Pattern Legs

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-2.png)

- Upwind leg
- Crosswind leg
- Downwind leg
- Base leg
- Final approach
- Departure

---

## Traffic Pattern Entry and Exit

![bg left:50% contain](images/image-7.png)

- Enter in level flight abeam the midpoint of the runway
- If remaining in the pattern, start crosswind leg within 300' of pattern altitude
- When departing the pattern, depart straight-out or 34&deg; in the direction of the pattern
- When operating with parallel runways, don't overshoot the final turn

---

## Preferred Mid-Field Traffic Pattern Entry

---

## Visual indicators

![h:350](images/image.png)

- Segmented circle/traffic pattern indicator: Shows traffic pattern direction
- Tetrahedron: Land in the direction that it's pointed

---

## Right-of-way [91.113](/_references/14-CFR/91.113)

- When two airplanes are approaching to land, the lower one has right-of-way
- However, you cannot take advantage of this by cutting in front of another aircraft

---

## Airports with a Control Tower

- Maintain contact with the control tower while you're in the airspace
- Some airports have a radar display, but not all
  - Traffic advisories
  - Recommended headings

---

## Runway Distances

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field.jpeg>)

- TORA: Takeoff runway Available, usually the length of the runway
- TODA: Takeoff distance available, TODA + any clearway/stopway beyond the end of the runway
- ASDA: Accelerate-Stop Distance Available: Distance available to accelerate and stop
- LDA: Landing distance available: Runway length, minus any displayed threshold

<!--
These may be less than physical distances to account for runway safety area buffers
-->

---

## Intersection Takeoffs

- Controller will give you take off distance available from intersection
- Pilots need to accept or decline

---

## Wake Turbulence Holds

![bg left:35% fit](images/image-5.png)

- ATC will hold light aircraft for 3 minutes if a large aircraft has just takeoff
- "Hold for wake turbulence"
- Pilots can request to waive this, "Request to waiver 3 minute interval"

---

## LAHSO: Land and hold short operations

- Land before an intersecting runway or taxiway
- PIC needs to accept or decline
- Land and hold short points are listed in the Chart Supplement
  - Available Landing Distance (ALD) listed for each
- Example: `N12382 cleared to land runway six right, hold short of taxiway bravo for crossing traffic B737.`
- Need basic VFR weather conditions

---

## Light Gun Signals

![alt text](images/image-4.png)

---

## ATC Phraseology

- Ground control frequencies ("GROUND POINT 7" means 121.7)
- "Cleared for the option", means cleared for one of:
  - Touch-and-go
  - Low approach
  - Missed approach
  - Stop-and-go
  - Full stop landing

---

## Aircraft lights

- Beacon/anti-collision lights on when aircraft is in motion
- Position/nav lights are required to be on sunset to sunrise
- Strobes should be used in flight (not when taxiing), unless reflecting in clouds is hazardous
- All lights should be used when crossing runways
- Operation Lights On
  - Pilots are encouraged to use landing light, day or night, up to 10,000'

---

## ASOS/AWOS

![bg left:45% fit](images/image-6.png)

- Should be available &lt; 10,000 ft within 25nm
- "I have the one-minute weather for Salem"
