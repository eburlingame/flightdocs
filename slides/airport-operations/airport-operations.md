# Airport Operations

---

## Objective

Identify airport operations and procedures, including traffic patterns, runway identifiers, and light gun signals. Understand the role of ATC and the importance of communication with them.

## Motivation

Understanding airport operations is critical for safe flight operations. Pilots need to be familiar with traffic patterns and the role of ATC in managing air traffic. This knowledge will help pilots navigate airports safely and efficiently.

## What are some hazards when flying near an airport?

<div class="h-stack">

![w:400](images/image-8.png)

- Traffic congestion
- Climbing/descending aircraft
- Different aircraft at different speeds
- Pilot preoccupation
- Mix of IFR and VFR traffic

</div>

## Overview of Airport Operations

![bg left:35%](images/image-9.png)

Airport procedures are standardized to minimize risk of collision and promote efficient flow of aircraft.

- Runway Identifiers
- Traffic Patterns
- Right-of-way Rules
- Airports with a Control Tower
- Runway Distances
- Wake Turbulence
- Aircraft Lights
- ASOS/AWOS

---

## Runway Identifiers

![bg left:40% contain](images/image-1.png)

- Aligned with magnetic north heading
- Example: Heading 140&deg;M gives runway 14
- Shift slowly over time
- Parallel runways will be given L, R, or C designations

---

## What is a traffic pattern?

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-2.png)

- Standardized rectangle aircraft fly around a given runway

---

## Traffic Pattern Altitude

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field.jpeg>)

- Chart supplement
- Propeller-driven aircraft: 1000' above field elevation
- Large or turbine aircraft: 1500' above field elevation
- Helicopters: 500', but may vary

---

## Traffic Pattern Direction

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field 2.jpeg>)

- Shown in chart supplement, sectional ("RP 36"), and ForeFlight
- If not shown, left traffic is implied

---

## Traffic Pattern Legs

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-2.png)

- Upwind leg
- Crosswind leg
- Downwind leg
- Base leg
- Final approach
- Departure

---

## Traffic Pattern Entry and Exit

![bg left:50% contain](images/image-7.png)

- Enter in level flight abeam the midpoint of the runway
- If remaining in the pattern, start crosswind leg within 300' of pattern altitude
- When departing the pattern, depart straight-out or 34&deg; in the direction of the pattern
- When operating with parallel runways, don't overshoot the final turn

---

## Preferred Mid-Field Traffic Pattern Entry

![h:550](images/image-3.png)

---

## Visual Wind Indicators

![h:350](images/image.png)

- Show which direction to fly a traffic pattern
- Segmented circle/traffic pattern indicator: Shows traffic pattern direction
- Tetrahedron: Land in the direction that it's pointed

---

## Right-of-way [91.113](/_references/14-CFR/91.113)

- When two airplanes are approaching to land, the lower one has right-of-way
- However, you cannot take advantage of this by cutting in front of another aircraft

---

## Airports with a Control Tower

- Maintain contact with the control tower while you're in the airspace
- Some airports have a radar display, but not all
  - Traffic advisories
  - Recommended headings

---

## Runway Distances

![h:300](<images/KVUO Pearson Field.jpeg>)

- TORA: Takeoff runway Available, usually the length of the runway
- TODA: Takeoff distance available, TODA + any clearway/stopway beyond the end of the runway
- ASDA: Accelerate-Stop Distance Available: Distance available to accelerate and stop
- LDA: Landing distance available: Runway length, minus any displayed threshold

<!--
These may be less than physical distances to account for runway safety area buffers
-->

---

## Intersection Takeoffs

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-10.png)

- Controller will give you take off distance available from intersection
- Pilots need to accept or decline
- Risks of intersection takeoffs:
  - Reduced takeoff distance
  - Less runway in case of an engine failure

---

## Wake Turbulence Holds

![bg left:35% fit](images/image-5.png)

- ATC will hold light aircraft for 3 minutes if a large aircraft has just takeoff
- "Hold for wake turbulence"
- Pilots can request to waive this, "Request to waiver 3 minute interval"

---

## Land And Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)

- Land before an intersecting runway or taxiway
- PIC needs to accept or decline
- Land and hold short points are listed in the Chart Supplement
  - Available Landing Distance (ALD) listed for each
- Example: `N12382 cleared to land runway six right, hold short of taxiway bravo for crossing traffic B737.`
- Need basic VFR weather conditions

---

## Light Gun Signals

![alt text](images/image-4.png)

---

## ATC Phraseology

- Ground control frequencies ("GROUND POINT 7" means 121.7)
- "Cleared for the option", means cleared for one of:
  - Touch-and-go
  - Low approach
  - Missed approach
  - Stop-and-go
  - Full stop landing

---

## Aircraft Lights ([91.209](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.209))

- Beacon/anti-collision lights on when aircraft is in motion
- Position/nav lights are required to be on sunset to sunrise
- Strobes should be used in flight (not when taxiing), unless reflecting in clouds is hazardous
- All lights should be used when crossing runways
- Operation Lights On
  - Pilots are encouraged to use landing light, day or night, up to 10,000'

---

## ASOS/AWOS

![bg left:45% fit](images/image-6.png)

- Should be available &lt; 10,000 ft within 25nm
- "I have the one-minute weather for Salem"

---

# Summary

- Runway Identifiers: Magnetic heading / 10
- Traffic Patterns: Left pattern at 1000' AGL, unless otherwise indicated
- Right-of-way Rules: Lower aircraft has right-of-way
- Airports with a Control Tower: Initial call 10 miles out, follow ATC instructions
- Runway Distances: TORA vs LDA
- Wake Turbulence: Visualize drift of vorticies, ATC will hold for 3 minutes
- Aircraft Lights: Beacon on all the time, nav/position sunset to sunrise
- ASOS/AWOS:

## Knowledge Check

Preparing to land at an untowered airport, you listen to the AWOS and hear the wind is 270&deg; at 10 knots. Looking at the wind sock though, you see it's point towards a heading of 180&deg;

Which direction should you fly the traffic pattern and land?

---

## Knowledge Check

You're on final to runway 36 at a towered airport. The controller tells you to "cleared for the option". What does that mean?

---

## Knowledge Check

You're on final to runway 18 at a towered airport with crossing runways. The controller tells you to "cleared to land runway 18, hold short of runway 36 for crossing traffic".

What does that mean? Do you have to comply?
