# Endorsements and Logbook Entries

---

## Objectives

To understand and apply the required endorsement for pilot training and currency when providing instruction.

---

## Overview

- Logbook requirements
- Flight reviews
- Endorsements
- Aircraft Category / Class Ratings
- Student pilot privileges and limitations
- Flight instructor currency requirements

---

### 61.51 Logbook Requirements for All Pilots

- Pilots need to maintain records:
  - For the requirements of a certificate or rating
  - For the recent flight experience requirements
- Logbook entries
  - Date
  - Total flight time or lesson time
  - Origin and destination
  - Type and identification of aircraft (or sim or ATD)
  - The name of a safety pilot, if required
  - Type of pilot experience or training: Solo, dual, PIC, SIC
  - Conditions of flight: Day, night, actual instrument, simulated instrument, simulator

<!-- Also NVG -->

---

## Logging Flight Time

- Acting vs logging pilot-in-command time
  - To act as PIC: Must be appropriately rated
    - Including flight reviews, passenger currency
    - Including IFR currency
    - Including tailwheel, high-performance, complex endorsements
    - Include type ratings, if required
  - To log PIC time: Sole manipulator of the controls
    - Also, when two pilots are required for the given operation
    - For example: IFR safety pilot or type rated A/C requiring two crew members
      - Safety pilot may log any hood time as PIC time
    -

Letters of Interpretation:

- 1980 Jones Letter: Logging PIC separate from acting PIC
- 1993 Hicks Letter: Hood flight time is an operation requiring two pilots
- 2009 Speranza Letter: Without hood time, only one person can log PIC time
- 2013 Richards Letter: HP/complex endorsements not required to log PIC time
- 2013 Creech Letter: Safety pilot is a required crew member
