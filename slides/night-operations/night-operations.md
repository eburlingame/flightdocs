# Night Operations

---

## Objective

To understand the risks and challenges for operating aircraft at night.

## Motivation

Night flying is a privilege of a private pilots, and involves numerous additional risk factors from day flying. We want to know how to identify and mitigate those risk, and fly effectively when its dark.

---

## Overview

- The eye and night vision
- Dark Adaptation
- Night Illusions
- Legal definitions of night
- Night flying equipment
- Rotation Beacons
- Airport Lighting
- Pilot-Controlled Lighting
- Night takeoffs
- Night navigation
- Night approaches and landings
- Emergencies at night

## The Eye and Night Vision

![bg left:30% fit](images/image.png)

Visual receptors in our eyes:

- Cones: Very acute, color, detail, daytime
- Rods: Very sensitive, gray, peripheral, day and night
  - Become deficient with even mild hypoxia

---

## Vision Types

<div class="h-stack">

![w:400](images/image-3.png)

![w:400](images/image-4.png)

</div>

Vision types:

- Photopic vision: Primary central vision - cones
- Mesopic vision: Fading light vision - mix of cones and rods
- Scotopic vision: Dark conditions - rods

---

## Dark Adaptation

- Dark to light: Adaptation is almost instant
- Light to dark: Upwards of 30 minutes
  - Avoid bright light exposure for 30 minutes
  - Cones adjust in 5-10 minutes, the eyes become 100 times more sensitive to light
  - Rods adjust in 30 minutes, the eyes become 100,000 time more sensitive
  - White light can cause temporary blindness and illusions

---

## Factors Affecting Eyesight

- Rods require oxygen to function well
  - They can be impaired by cabin altitudes over 5,000 ft.
  - For this reason, oxygen use is recommended at night over 5,000'
- Fatigue
- Illness
- Smoking
- Drugs
- Alcohol
- Diet

---

# Night Illusions

---

## False Horizon

<div class="h-stack">

![h:600](images/image-6.png)

</div>

---

## Autokinesis

![bg right:50% fit](images/image-5.png)

- Staring at a single point of light against a dark background for several seconds
- The light will appear to move on its own
- Avoid fixating on single points of light and vary the focus of your eye
- Use good visual scanning technique, scanning the sky in chunks for a few seconds at a time

---

## Flicker Vertigo

- Light flickering at a rate between 4 and 20 cycles per second
- Can produce unpleasant or dangerous reactions
- Nausea, vomiting, and vertigo
- Use good visual scanning techniques, avoiding fixation

---

## Black Hole

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-8.png)

Use caution when approaching to land with no lights except the runway lights, like over water or rural areas.

- This can cause the pilot to fly the approach lower than intended
- Use a runway with a VASI or PAPI
- Overfly the airport and fly a regular traffic pattern
- IFR pilots: Use an approach with vertical guidance (ILS, LPV, or Garmin visual)

---

## Bright Approach Lights

![bg left:45% fit](images/image-7.png)

- Bright approach lights can make you seem closer than you actually are
- Add glare on the windscreen
- Can become blinding as you approach the runway
- For pilot-controlled lighting, use a lower intensity

---

## Using Landing Lights in Clouds

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-9.png)

- Illumination of the clouds can cause distortion in the window
- Avoid using landing or taxi lights when flying in the clouds
- Avoid using stroke when in clouds

---

# Legal Requirements for Night Operations

---

## Legal Definitions of Night

![bg right:40% fit](images/image-1.png)

There are three different legal definitions of night.

- Aircraft lights (91.209): Sunset to sunrise
  - Position/nav lights on
- Night flight (FAR Part 1) - End of evening civil twilight to start of morning civil twilight
  - Needed to log night flight hours for a certificate/rating
- 90-day night currency (61.57) - 1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise

---

## Night Flying Equipment

![bg right:35% fit](images/image-10.png)

- Two flashlights, with spare batteries
  - Large white flash light for preflight
  - A smaller red flashlight for use in the cockpit
- Don't preflight with the red light, since hydraulic fluid may be read
- Headlamps with a white/red setting can be helpful in the cockpit

---

## Night VFR - Required Equipment (91.205c)

- FLAPS
  - **F**uses (spares)
  - **L**anding light
  - **A**nti-collision light
  - **P**osition lights
  - **S**ource of electrical power

---

## Position Light Requirements (91.209)

<div class="h-stack">

![h:400](images/image-11.png)

</div>

- Anti-collision or beacon lights must be on all the time
- Position lights must be on from sunset to sunrise

# Airport Lighting

---

## Rotation Beacons

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-12.png)

Airport colors:

- White/green: Lighted land airport
- Two white flashes/green: Military airport
- White/yellow: Lighted water airport
- White/yellow/green: Lighted heliport

A beacon operating during the daytime may indicate IFR conditions.

---

## Runway Lights

![h:400](images/image-14.png)

- Various types of approach lighting systems
- Run/green bidirectional lights are used to mark the end of the runway

---

## Runway Lights (cont.)

![bg left:45% contain](images/image-15.png)

- Centerline lights
  - White lights mark the centerline of the runway
  - Last 3000' of runway: Alternate red and white lights
  - Last 1000' of runway: All red lights
- Edge lights
  - White lights
  - Last 2000' of runway: Yellow lights

---

## Pilot-Controlled Lighting (PCL)

![bg left:50% fit](images/IMG_D76061BC6E1E-1.jpeg)

- Usually on the CTAF frequency
  - Check chart supplement to confirm
- Clicking the microphone changes the intensity
  - 3 clicks: low intensity
  - 5 clicks: medium intensity
  - 7 clicks: high intensity

---

## Taxiway Lights

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-13.png)

- Blue lights outline the taxiway
- Green lights mark the taxiway centerline (at some airports)

---

### Runway Guard Lights - Hold short bars

Used to indicate hold short bars

---

## Start, Taxi, and Runup at Night

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-19.png)

- Beacon/anti-collision lights on before starting engine
- Taxi with taxi lights, or landing lights on (if equipped)
- Hold brakes firmly during runup
  - It's difficult to detect any movement of the aircraft

---

## Night Takeoffs

- Relay on flight instruments, since fewer visual references are available
- Ensure a positive rate of climb using the altimeter and VSI
- Use heading indicator to maintain heading

---

## Night Navigation

![bg left:50% fit](images/image-18.png)

- Be careful with iPad brightness at night
- Use good pilotage
  - Cross-check urban areas on the sectional with city lights
  - Identify airports and obstacles where you expect them

---

### Beacons on a Sectional

![h:275](images/image-21.png)

### Lighted Obstacles

![](images/image-22.png)

---

## Night Approaches and Landings

![bg right:38% fit](images/image-20.png)

- Identify the airport and runway early
- Fly a normal traffic pattern
- Use normal power and flap settings
- Use a heading bug on the runway heading to help prevent disorientation
- Fly a stabilized approach
  - Use the VASI or PAPI
  - Use glideslope indicator, if available
- It can be difficult to judge distance and height
  - Tendency to approach slow and flare high
  - Practice landings without a landing light

---

## Judging Flare Height

<div class="h-stack">

![h:480](images/image-23.png)

</div>

Round out just when tire marks become visible on the runway.

---

## Emergencies at Night

What is a minor emergency in the day may be a major emergency at night.

- Engine failure:
  - Same emergency procedure as the day, but landing options will be limited
- Alternator failure:
  - Attempt to reset the alternator with circuit breakers and master switch
  - Otherwise, turn off non-essential equipment and land

---

# Summary

- Dark adaptation: 30 minutes to adjust
- Night illusions: Good scanning habits
- Legal definitions of night: Logging vs lights vs currency
- Night flying equipment: FLAPS
- Rotation beacons: Airports are green and white
- Airport lighting: PCL 3, 5, 7 clicks
- Night takeoffs: Use your instruments
- Night navigation: Use good pilotage
- Night approaches: Use glideslope aid
- Emergencies at night: Land on what you can see, but know the risks

## Knowledge Check

You are flying at night and see a white light and a green light ahead of you.

What is the other aircraft's relative position?

---

## Knowledge Check

You see a light on the ground that has two white flashes, then a green flash.

Can you land at that airport?

---

## Knowledge Check

Your engine fails at night. You are flying above and Interstate highway.

Would you land on the highway? What are some of your concerns?

---

## Knowledge Check

You are on a long cross-country flight at night in eastern Washington. You are flying over a large area of unlit terrain. In the distance you see a group of synchronized flashing red lights.

What do you think they are?
