## Airworthiness Requirements

---

## Objective

To understand the requirements and documents that proves that our airplane is airworthy, both from a legal perspective and a safety perspective.

## Motivation

A pilot should be able to determine the airworthiness status of an airplane given the logbooks and maintenance records to determine if it is safe and legal to fly.

---

## Overview

- Type certificates and airworthiness certificates
- ARROWS documents - in the plane
- AV1ATED checklist - maintain the plane
- Aircraft logbooks
- Aircraft equipment lists
- 91.205, required VFR equipment
- Kind of Equipment List (KOEL)
- Minimum Equipment List (MEL), 91.213
- Special Flight Permits
- Preventative Maintenance

---

## Airworthiness Definition

Airworthiness means the aircraft is legal to fly, meeting the airworthiness criteria defined by the FAA.

---

## Who is responsible for determining airworthiness?

Per [91.7](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.7#p-91.7(b)>):

> The pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether that aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The pilot in command shall discontinue the flight when unairworthy mechanical, electrical, or structural conditions occur.

---

## Aircraft Certification

![bg left:35% fit](images/image-6.png)

- When an aircraft is designed it undergoes a certification process for the model being produced
- Following certification, the model receives a type certificate and authorization for production
- When that model of aircraft is manufactured they receive an airworthiness certificate
- Each type has a type certificate data sheet (TCDS), which includes various information about the type

---

## Standard vs Special Airworthiness Certificate

![bg right:35% fit](images/image-17.png)

- Standard Airworthiness Certificate: "Certified" aircraft
- Special Airworthiness Certificate, other types of aircraft:
  - Experimental
  - Restricted
  - Limited
  - Provisional
  - Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA)

---

## Supplemental Type Certificates - Changes to Original Designs

- Used for major modifications to an existing certified aircraft
- Requires engineering work to prove the safety of the aircraft following the change
- Examples:
  - Retrofit avionics and autopilots
  - Different engines or propellers
  - After-market turbochargers

---

## D - Airworthiness Directives

- Airworthiness directives are legally-required mandates made by the FAA to correct an unsafe condition in a product
- Used to correct deficiencies after an airplane has been certified
- Can require a one-time fix or inspection
- May require a recurring inspection
- Two types:
  - Emergency issue: Addressing a urgent, safety-of-flight issue
    - Example: 737 MAX groundings
  - Normal issue: Less urgent, usually requires compliance within a specified period

---

## Example A.D.

- Life-limited parts may be required per the original type certificate or an AD
  - Listed in the type certificate data sheet
- Examples: Helicopter rotor blades, turbine fan blades
- Less common on light airplanes

---

## Service Bulletins (S.B.'s)

- Service bulletins are issued by the manufacturer
- Describe recommended inspections or maintenance
- Not regulatory
- Some SB's are labelled as "Mandatory Service Bulletins", which usually affect flight safety
- A.D.'s often start as service bulletins

---

## Time Between Overhauls (TBO)

---

## Inoperative Equipment

- Under 14 CFR, all installed equipment must be operational prior to a flight
- If a piece of equipment is not operational we can:
  - Fix the piece of equipment
  - Defer maintenance of the item, for some items

---

## Equipment We Have to Fix ([91.213(d)(2)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(2)>))

- Those required for specific operations by Part 91, including:
  - Day VFR equipment 91.205(b) - ATOMATOFLAMES
  - Night VFR equipment 91.205(c) - FLAPS
- Those required per the Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL), if present
- Those required by an AD to be operative

---

## Kinds of Operation Equipment List

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-4.png)

- Define what is required for the kind of operation being performed
  - Day
  - Night
  - IFR
  - VFR

---

## Deferral of Maintenance ([91.213(d)(3)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(3)>))

![bg left:30% fit](images/image-15.png)

If we deem the system is not required, we can:

- Remove it, or deactivated
- Placard it as inoperative

If the deactivation requires a mechanic, then it will need to be done by a mechanic and logged appropriately.

Note: Removal of equipment may change the W&B of the airplane.

---

## Minimum Equipment List

If our aircraft has a minimum equipment list, refer to the list

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-5.png)

- Gives specific instruction on what can be inoperative
- Inoperative equipment must be dealt with per the MEL (can't use the previous process)
- Master MELs (MMELs) are publish by the manufacturer
  - Operators can then create their own MEL for a specific aircraft

---

## Special Flight Permits

- What happens if we need to move the airplane to make repairs while it's not airworthy?
- A Special Flight Permit allows for a specific flight
- Can requested from the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)
- May require an A&P to determine the safety of flight
- Reasons for a permit:
  - To fly to base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance can be done
  - Delivering or exporting an aircraft
  - Evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger
  - Allow an overweight aircraft to fly beyond its normal range over water

---

## Preventative Maintenance

- As a private pilot, you are permitted to do some maintenance tasks on your airplane
- Permitted tasks are listed in [Part 43 Appendix A](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)>)
  - Remove, install, and repair landing gear tires
  - Service landing gear wheel bearings
  - Replenish hydraulic fluid
  - Replace safety belt
  - Replace bulbs, reflectors, and lenses of lights
  - Replace or clean spark plugs
  - Replace and service batteries
  - Replace hose connections, except hydraulic connection

---

## Logging of Preventative Maintenance

Pilots who perform preventive maintenance must make an entry in the maintenance record:

Include the following information:

1. A description of the work, such as “changed oil (Shell Aero-50) at 2,345 hours”
   - Should be logged "in accordance with" a maintenance document
2. The date of completion of the work performed
3. The pilot’s name, signature, certificate number, and type of certificate held
