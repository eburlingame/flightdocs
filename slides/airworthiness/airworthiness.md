## Airworthiness Requirements

---

## Objective

To understand the requirements and documents that proves that our airplane is airworthy, both from a legal perspective and a safety perspective.

## Motivation

A pilot should be able to determine the airworthiness status of an airplane given the logbooks and maintenance records to determine if it is safe and legal to fly.

---

## Overview

- Type certificates and airworthiness certificate
- AV1ATED checklist
- Aircraft logbooks
- Aircraft equipment lists
- 91.205, required VFR equipment
- Kind of Equipment List (KOEL)
- Minimum Equipment List (MEL), 91.213
- Special Flight Permits
- Preventative Maintenance

---

## Airworthiness Definition

Airworthiness means the aircraft is legal to fly, meeting the airworthiness criteria defined by the FAA.

---

## Who is responsible for determining airworthiness?

Per [91.7](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.7#p-91.7(b)>):

> The pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether that aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The pilot in command shall discontinue the flight when unairworthy mechanical, electrical, or structural conditions occur.

## Airworthiness Certificates

![bg left:35% fit](images/image.png)

- When an aircraft is designed it undergoes a certification process for the model being produced
- When that model of aircraft is manufactured they recieve an airworthiness certificate
- These have no expiration and are valid so long as the airplane is maintained

---

## What documents do we need to legally fly?

ARROW:

1. **A**irworthiness certificate: Displayed where passengers can see it
2. **R**egistration certificate: State and local
3. **R**adio station license from FCC, for flight outside the U.S.

- If a piece of equipment is not operational we can:
  - Fix the piece of equipment
  - Defer maintenance of the item, for some items

---

## Equipment We Have to Fix ([91.213(d)(2)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(2)>))

- Those required for specific operations by Part 91, including:
  - Day VFR equipment 91.205(b) - ATOMATOFLAMES
  - Night VFR equipment 91.205(c) - FLAPS
- Those required for the airworthiness of the aircraft
- Those required per the Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL), if present
- Those required by an AD to be operative

---

## Kinds of Operation Equipment List

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-4.png)

- Define what is required for the kind of operation being performed
  - Day
  - Night
  - IFR
  - VFR

---

## Deferral of Maintenance ([91.213(d)(3)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91/section-91.213#p-91.213(d)(3)>))

If we deem the system is not required, we can:

- Remove it, or deactivated
- Placard it as inoperative

If the deactivation requires a mechanic, then it will need to be done by a mechanic and appropriate logged.

---

## Minimum Equipment List

If our aircraft has a minimum equipment list, defer to the required equipment on the list.

![bg left:40% fit](images/image-5.png)

- Gives specific instruction on what can be inoperative
- Inoperative equipment must be dealt with per the MEL, they can't use the previous process
- Master MELs (MMELs) can be created after the fact, and apply to an existing airframe

---

## Special Flight Permits

- What happens if we need to move the airplane to make repairs while it's not airworthy?
- A Special Flight Permit allows for a specific flight
- Can requested from the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)
- Usually requires an A&P to determine the safety of flight
- Reasons for a permit
  - To fly to base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance can be done
  - Delivering or exporting an aircraft
  - Evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger
  - Allow an overweight aircraft to fly beyond its normal range over water

---

## Preventative Maintenance

- As a private pilot, you are permitted to do some maintenance tasks on your airplane
- Permitted tasks are listed in [Part 43 Appendix A](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043#p-Appendix-A-to-Part-43(c)>)
  - Remove, install, and repair landing gear tires
  - Service landing gear wheel bearings
  - Replenish hydraulic fluid
  - Replace safety belt
  - Replace bulbs, reflectors, and lenses of lights
  - Replace or clean spark plugs
  - Replace and service batteries
  - Replace hose connections, except hydraulic connection
  - Lubricate items not needed disassembly

---

## Logging of Preventative Maintenance

Pilots who perform preventive maintenance must make an entry in the maintenance record:

Include the following information:

1. A description of the work, such as “changed oil (Shell Aero-50) at 2,345 hours”
2. The date of completion of the work performed
3. The pilot’s name, signature, certificate number, and type of certificate held

---

## Knowledge Check

You find an airplane with fuel gauge inoperative. Can you fly it?

What if we need to fly the airplane to another airport to get it fixed?

---

## Knowledge Check

Can a private pilot do an oil change?

What about a student pilot?

---

## Knowledge Check

Does a flight school's 172's need a 100-hour inspection?

What about a flying club?

---

## Knowledge Check

Do you need a landing light to fly for flight instruction?
