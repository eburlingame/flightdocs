# Runway Incursion Avoidance

---

## What is a runway incursion?

> Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle, or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.

---

## Ground Operation Challenges

- Airplanes are awkward and slow on the ground
- Visibility can be difficult
- Airplanes are in close proximity
- Complex runway and taxiway layouts

---

## Extra Care

![bg left:30%](images/image-39.png)

- NOTAMs
- Hot spots
- Intersecting runways
- Complex intersections
- ILS critical areas

---

## Taxi Clearances

- Expectation vs actual taxi instructions (expectation bias)
- Always record taxi instruction
- Unambiguous understanding of instructions
- Display an airport diagram in the cockpit (especially on a moving map)
- Use progressive taxi if unsure or unfamiliar

---

## Example Clearance

The ATC clearance is:

> N2017E taxi runway 9R via Bravo, Echo Juliet, Hold Short 4L at Echo

The ATC clearance written:

> 9R B E J <u>4L</u> E.

Where the clearance limit of 4L at Echo is circled.

(AC 91-73B)

## Hold Short Lines

![h:300](images/image-37.png)

- Stop prior to any hold short line
- An explicit clearance ("cross runway 12") is always required
- Notice enhanced centerline stripes prior to the hold short line
- When in doubt, stop and ask ATC if you're cleared to cross

---

## Distractions and Workload

- Keep additional workload to a minimum
- Avoid distractions while taxiing
  - Communicating with ATC, if not necessary
  - Programming avionics
  - Run-up procedures
  - Conversation with passengers
- Disorientation can lead to confusion

---

## Specific Scenarios

![h:300](images/image-38.png)

- Departing the runway after landing
  - Move past the hold short line, run any checklists, then contact ATC
- Rolling out onto a taxiway near another runway
- Taxiing between parallel runways
  - Exercise increased awareness when taxing in between active parallel runways

<!-- Remember the runway safety area extends to the hold short line -->

---

## Uncontrolled Airfields

- Always scan the runway before entering
- Announce your intentions on the common frequency (AIM 4-1-9)
  - Announce before taxiing
  - Announce before taking a runway for takeoff
  - Announce when clear of runway after landing
- Remember not all airplanes have radios
