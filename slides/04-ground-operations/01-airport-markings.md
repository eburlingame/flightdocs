---

## Movement Area Boundary

![alt text](images/image-1.png)

- Separates ramp from movement area
- Need a clearance to cross at an airport with a control tower

---

## Taxiway signs

![alt text](images/image-3.png)

- Black-backed text indicates taxiway you are on (taxiway direction sign)
- Yellow-backed text indicates direction to destination (taxiway location sign)

---

## Taxiway Intersection

![h:400](images/image-5.png)

- A dashed yellow lines indicates a hold short, then a clearance is required to cross

---

## Destination Signs

![alt text](images/image-4.png)

- Runway destination signs
- Dot separates multiple runways

---

## Runway Safety Area

![h:350](images/image-18.png)

- Buffer zone which reduces the risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot overshoot, or excursion from the runway

---

## Crossing a Runway

![h:380](images/image-6.png)

<!--
Sign: Runway holding position sign
 -->

- Stop before the hold short bars
- Need a clearance to cross
- Runways numbers are placed on the corresponding side of the sign

---

## Crossing a Runway

![](images/image-7.png)

- Dashed to solid, crossing ok
- Solid to dashed, need a clearance
- Completely cross the entire line to be clear of the runway

---

## Crossing a Runway

![alt text](images/image-9.png)

- Runway identifiers also painted on the ground
- See red, think STOP

---

## Holding Short of a Runway

![alt text](images/image-8.png)

- Runway holding position sign (at runway end)

---

## ILS Hold Position Area

![h:500](images/image-10.png)

- ILSs have critical areas that must be kept clear of all obstacles

---

## ILS Hold Position Area

![w:500](images/image-11.png)

- ATC phraseology will be `HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 36 ILS CRITICAL AREA.`

---

## Runway Approach Area Holding

![w:400](images/image-12.png)

- ATC: `Hold short of Runway XX approach or Runway XX departure area`

---

## Runway Approach Area Holding

![alt text](images/image-13.png)

---

## No Entry Sign

---

## Runway Location Sign

![alt text](images/image-21.png)

- Identifies which runway you are on

---

## Runway Distance Remaining

![h:450](images/image-22.png)

- Identifies how much runway is remaining in 1000's of feet

---

## Displaced Threshold

![h:425](images/image-15.png)

- Can be used for takeoff, but not for landing
- Ok to rollout when landing from opposite direction

---

## Displaced Threshold

![h:450](images/image-16.png)

---

## Blastpad or Stopway
