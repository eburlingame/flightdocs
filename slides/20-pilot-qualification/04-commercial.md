## Knowledge Check

Right after earning your commercial pilot certificate, the DPE needs to fly to an airport 25 miles away. They will only be there for 1 hour, and will need
you to fly me back. I will pay you $100 plus the cost of the rental airplane. Can you make this flight legally?

* No. While a commercial pilot certificate grants you the privilege to carry persons or property for compensation or hire, you must also meet the requirements of the applicable parts (e.g. Part 119; 133, 135, 137 etc.) of the regulation.
