### Pitot-static instruments

## Static air pressure: Altimeter, VSI

- Operate on air pressure alone

---

## RAM air pressure: Airspeed indicator

- Airspeed = (RAM air pressure - static pressure)
- Operates with a diaphragm

---

## Types of airspeed

- Indicated airspeed (IAS)
- Calibrated airspeed (CAS)
- True airspeed (TAS)
- Ground speed (GS)

---

## Airspeed indicator markings

---

## Pitot static blockages

- RAM air block: Airspeed reads 0
- RAM air and drain hole blocked: Airspeed reads whatever it was blocked (lower if descending, higher if ascending)

---

## Altimeter

- Remember, pressure decreases at about 1 in Hg per 1000'
- Converts ambient pressure into altimeter
- Can be compensated for non-standard pressure
- Effects of cold weather

---

## Vertical speed indicator

- Derivative of the altimeter, the trend of the altitude
- Consists of a diaphragm with a calibrated leak

---

## Vacuum-pressure/gyroscopic instruments

- Vacuum-driven gyroscopic system drive the attitude and heading indicators
- Sometimes the turn coordinator

---

## Attitude indicator

- Two-axis gyros spinning 90 degrees to one another

---

## Heading indicator

- Earth rotates in space at a rate of 15Â° in 1 hour

---

## Turn coordinator/inclinometer

---

## Vacuum/pressure gauge

---

### Magnetic compass

- Turning errors
- UNOS
- ANDS
