---
An *authentic* type of assessment is effective for evaluating a student's higher-order thinking skills while performing real-world tasks.
---
During a go-around, it is generally better to retract the *flaps* first, then the *gear*.
---
In a multi-engine airplane, the Vmc speed is highest when the CG is the most *aft*.
---
If an increase in power results in the raising of the aircraft's nose, then the line of thrust is *below* the aircraft's *center of gravity|CG*.
---
*Phugoid* oscillations are long-period oscillations of an aircraft around its lateral axis, which results in a slow changes in *pitch* accompanied by equally slow changes in *airspeed*.
---
The *pilot* is always considered the referenced center of effect as the flight controls are used.
---
Fuel consumption is primarily dependent of *percent horsepower|% horsepower*.
---
Flying below *Va* allows for full deflection of an *one|single* control surface (rudder, aileron, elevator), but not multiple control surfaces.
---
The horizontal force acting upon an airplane during a turn is divided into two components:
- *Centripetal* - inward
- *Centrifugal* - outward
---
While an engine is running, a cylinder piston undergoes four phases:
1. *Intake*, when air and fuel is drawn into the cylinder
2. *Compression*, the piston moves back to the top and compresses the fuel-air mixture
3. *Power*, the ignited gasses expand and drive the piston downward
4. *Exhaust*, the cylinder is purged of burned gasses
---
Before acting as PIC of a pressurized airplane (with a service ceiling or maximum operating altitude above *25,000|25000,25k* ft. MSL), a pilot must receive and log *ground* training from an authorized instructor. 

Additionally, that pilot must have received *flight* training in a pressurized aircraft or flight simulator.

(61.31)
---
A student must have received, within the last *90* days, a solo endorsement for each *make* and *model* of aircraft in which they intend to fly solo.

(61.87)
---
A student pilot must obtain a cross-country endorsement from an authorized instructor in order to make solo cross-country flights, or any flight greater than *25*nm from the origin.

(61.93)
---
Private pilot applicants are required to have *3* hours of night flight training, including *10* takeoffs and landings to a full stop, and one cross-country flight in excess of *100*nm total distance.

(61.109)
---
Private pilot applicants are required to have:
- *3* hours of dual cross-country time
- *10* hours of solo flight time, including *5* hours of solo cross-country time
- One solo XC flight in excess of *150* total, with landings at *3* points, plus one segment greater than *50*nm

(61.109)
---
Commercial pilot applicants are required to have:
- *100* hours of PIC time, including
  - *50* hours in airplanes
  - *50* hours of cross-country flight time, of which *10* hours must be in airplanes

(61.129)
---
No person may operate an aircraft in aerobatic flight:
- Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement;
- Over an open air assembly of persons;
- Within the lateral boundaries of the surface areas of Class B/C/D/E airspace designated for an airport;
- Within *4* nautical miles of the center line of any Federal airway;
- Below an altitude of *1,500* feet above the surface; or
- When flight visibility is less than *3* statute miles

(91.303)
---
Guidance for flight reviews can be found in *AC 61-98*.
---
A recreational pilot cannot carry more than *1|one* passenger.

(61.101)
---
A recreational pilot requires a specific logbook endorsement for the following activities:
- Flight within *50*nm of the departure airport
- XC flights farther than *50*nm of the departure airport
- Flights in Class B, C, or D airspace

(61.101)
---
A recreational pilot may fly solo in an aircraft for which the pilot does not hold the required *category* or *class* rating, provided the flying is for the purpose of obtaining additional certificates or ratings. This flying requires an endorsement in the pilot's logbook for *each|every* flight by an authorized instructor.

(61.101)
---
In order to provide flight training to an initial CFI applicant, an instructor is required to have at least *200* hours of flight training and have held their certificate for at least *24* months. 

In order to provide ground training to an initial CFI applicant, an instructor is required to have at least *40* hours of ground training and have held their certificate for at least *24* months, or has given *100* hours of ground training in an FAA-approved course.

(61.195)
---
Students sitting on the left will have a tendency to *dive* into left turn, since the nose appears to *rise* during the entry into the turn. This is due to the pilot sinking in relation to the *longitudinal* axis of the aircraft.
---
For pilot training and testing purposes, slow flight includes two main elements:
- Slowing to and maneuvering just above *stall speed*
- Practice maneuvers related to [*takeoffs* and *landings*] in those configurations

(AFK 5-9)
---
When operating on the same runway as a large aircraft:

- When arriving behind the large aircraft: Stay *above* their flight path and land *beyond* its touchdown point
- When arriving behind a departing large aircraft: Land well *before|prior* to the their rotation point
- When departing behind a large aircraft: 
  - Rotate *prior|before* to the larger aircraft's rotation point
  - Climb *above* their flight path before turning clear of the wake
