---
In the northern hemisphere, air flows *clockwise|cw* around a high presssure area, and *counterclockwise|counter-clockwise|ccw* around a low pressure area.
---
The angle of incidence is the angle between the wing's *chord line* and the *fuselage*.
---
Propeller efficiency is the ratio of *thrust* horsepower to *brake* horsepower.
---
*Geometric* pitch is the theoretical distance a propeller should advance in one revolution; *effective* pitch is the distance it actually advances.

The difference between these two is known as propeller *slip*.
---
When using a VOR testing center, the CDI should read *180* &deg; TO and *360* &deg; FROM.
---
A flight review must consist of *1 hour* of flight training and *1 hour* of ground training.
---
If the holder of an airplane SEL pilot certificate applies for a multi-engine class rating, the pilot will not need to take a *written* test, nor are there any minimum *flight hour|hour* requirements.
---
The best rate of climb speed with one engine inoperative (*Vyse*) is indicated with a *blue* radial line on the airspeed indicator.
---
Low propeller pitch is a *smaller|small* bite of air, high propeller pitch is a *larger|large|big* bite of air.
---
In cruise flight with a constant-speed propeller, an increase in airspeed will *increase* the pitch of the propeller, and a decrease in airspeed with *increase* the pitch of the propeller.
---
A clockwise turning propeller will have a tendency to yaw the aircraft to the *left*, and roll the aircraft to the *right*.
---
Label the axes:

- Red: *Longitudinal* axis
- Green: *Lateral* axis
- Blue: *Vertical* axis

![Flap types]([flap-types.png](https://flightdocs.io/img/content/flap-types.png))

1. *Plain* flap
2. *Split* flap
3. *Slotted* flap
4. *Fowler* flap
5. *Slotted fowler* flap
---
A leading edge slot will delay the stall to a higher *angle of attack|aoa*.
---
*Split* flaps create the least change in pitching moment.
---
*Maneuverability* allows and aircraft to be operated easily and withstand the stresses imposed on it.
---
The following oxygen requirements must be followed:

- Above *12,500*, the flight crew must use oxygen for the portion of the flight time more than 30 minutes
- Above *14,000* the flight crew must use oxygen all the time
- Above *15,000* the flight crew must use oxygen all the time, and the passengers must be provided oxygen
---
An aircraft engaged in training operations without an operating ELT cannot fly more than *50*nm from an airport.

(91.207f)
---
An aircraft loaded at the aft CG limit will have the *lowest* stall speed and the *highest* cruise speed. 
---
The most pertinent/primary information for pitch control in straight-and-level flight is given by the *altimeter*.
---
When flying low over hilly terrain, the greatest potential danger from turbulent air current will usually be encountered on the *leeward* side, when flying with a *headwind*.
---
The maximum intensity winds in a microburst will last *2* to *4* minutes.
---
If an ELT has been removed for maintenance, the aircraft may be operated for up to *90* days.
---
Conviction of an offense involving alcohol or drugs is grounds for *suspension* or *revocation* of any certificate or rating issued under part 61.
---
The fuel/air ratio is the ratio of the *weight* of the fuel and the *weight* of the air entering the cylinder.
---
Detonation occurs with high *cylinder temperatures|cylinder temps* and high *power setting|power*.
---
An airplane leaving ground effect will experience a *pitch up|pitch-up* tendency.
---
Tornadoes, embedded thunderstorms, and hail 3/4" or larger is included in a *convective sigmet*.
---
In a descending right turn, if excessive left rudder is applied to compensate for the decreased torque effect, a *slip* will occur. 
---
An aircraft may not operate below 10,000 ft. MSL at an indicated airspeed above *250* knots.

Additionally, within *4* nautical miles of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area at an indicated airspeed of more than *200* knots.

Below Class B airspace, or within a VFR corridor at more than *200* knots.
---
Within an aircraft traffic pattern located within Class B airspace, the maximum indicated airspeed is *250* knots.
---
ELT batteries must be replaced after *1* hour of cumulative use.
---
*Skin friction* drag is caused by air moving over the surface of the aircraft
---
During a steep turn, the rudder is used to *prevent yawing*.
---
Within any consecutive 24 hour period, an instructor may not perform more that *8* hours of flight training.
---
A flight instructor may not give training in a multiengine airplane unless that flight instructor has at least *5* flight hours of pilot-in-command time in the specific make and model.
---
The lift produced by an airfoil is a net force which acts perpendicular to the *relative wind*.
---
A line drawn from the leading to trailing edge of an airfoil, that is equidistance at all points from all points upper and lower contours is known as the *mean camber line*.
---
