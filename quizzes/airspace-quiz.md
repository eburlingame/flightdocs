Unless otherwise charted, Class E airspace begins at *14,500|14500|14.5k* ft MSL, however most of the continental U.S. has Class E airspace starting at *1,200|1200* ft AGL.
---
In Class B airspace, the VFR weather minimums are *3* s.m. visibility and *clear* of clouds.
---
In Class C, D, and E airspace below 10,000' MSL, the VFR weather minimums are *3* s.m. visibility and *500*' below, *1000* above, and *2000*' horizontally from clouds.
---
