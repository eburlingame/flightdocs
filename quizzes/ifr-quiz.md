---
VOR checks have the following tolerances:
- A VOT or dual VOR check: &pm;*4*&deg;
- An airborne check: &pm;*6*&deg;
---
A VOT test station should show 360&deg; *FROM* the station and 180 degrees *TO* the station.
---
When tuned to a VOR on a standard 5-dot CDI, each dot represents *2* degrees of deflection off the selected course.
---
The minimum altitude for IFR is *2000* over mountainous terrain, and *1000* over non-mountainous terrain.

These altitudes are defined in *91.177*.
---
You are not required to file an alternate if your destination has an instrument approach and within &pm;*1* hour of your ETA the weather is forecast to be &gt;2000 ft. ceilings AND the visibility will be &gt;*3* s.m. Otherwise, filing an alternate is required.
---
To select an alternate, the airport must:
- Have a usable precision approach, with weather forecasted to be least *600* ft. AND *2* s.m. of visibility
- Have a usable non-precision approach, with weather forecasted to be least *800* ft. AND *2* s.m. of visibility
- Have no instrument approach, with weather forecast to allow decent and landing under basic *VFR*
---
A cruise clearance allows a pilot to cruise at any altitude from the *minimum for IFR* up to the altitude assigned by ATC. It also automatically clears you for an instrument *approach* at your destination.
---
You are required to notify ATC when your true airspeed changes by 10 knots or *5*%.

(AIM 5-3-3)
---
You are required to notify ATC when you're unable to climb/descend of at least *500* fpm. 

(AIM 5-3-3)
---
The holding speed limits are:
- Up to 6,000 feet MSL: *200* KIAS
- 6,001 to 14,000 feet MSL: *230* KIAS
- Above 14,000 feet MSL: *265* KIAS
---
When crossing a fix on an airway with a new MEA on the other side, you may start your climb *after* the fix.

When crossing a fix on an airway with a published MCA, you must climb to the MCA altitude *before* crossing the fix.
---
A standard rate turn is *2* minutes for a 360&deg; turn, a rate of *3*&deg; per second.
---
The fundamental skills of attitude instrument flying are:
1. *Cross-check*
2. *Instrument interpretation*
3. *Aircraft control*
---
The slant-range error for a DME is negligible when the aircraft is at least *1*nm from the station for every *1000* ft. above the station.
---
The speed limit for procedures turns is *200* knots.

(AIM 5-4-9)
---
The standard procedure turn/course reversal restriction is to remain within *10*nm.
---
When flight planning, restricted and prohibited areas should be avoided by at least *3*nm.
---
The â€¡ "double dagger" symbol, listed after times in the chart supplement, the effective hours will be one hour earlier during daylight savings time.
---
An IFR GPS navigator should transition into APR mode within *2*nm of the FAWP.
---
A TAF is applicable within *5*nm of an airport.
---
If the entry is ambiguous, the standard priority for hold entries is:
1. *Direct*
2. *Teardrop*
3. *Parallel*

---

On the CFI-I written test, the following hold entries are correct:
- Enroute hold at TEMCO, eastbound, left turns: *teardrop* entry
- Enroute hold at TEMCO, eastbound, right turns: *parallel* entry
- The approach hold at EUG: *parallel* entry
