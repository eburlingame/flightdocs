# Region of Reverse Command

Flight in the region of normal command means that while holding a constant
altitude, a higher airspeed requires a higher power setting and a lower airspeed
requires a lower power setting. The majority of aircraft flying (climb, cruise,
and maneuvers) is conducted in the region of normal command.

Flight in the region of reversed command means:

- Flight in which a _higher_ airspeed requires a _lower_ power setting
- Flight in which a _lower_ airspeed requires a _higher_ power setting

Note that it does not imply that a decrease in power produces lower airspeed.

The power required curve represents the speed at which the lowest brake
horsepower sustains level flight.
