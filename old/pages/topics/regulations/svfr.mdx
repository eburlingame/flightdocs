# Special VFR

Special VFR allows for limited operations when the weather conditions are below
that of basic VFR at a controlled airport.

SVFR operations in weather conditions less than basic VFR minima are authorized:

- Where no prohibited by Part 91, Appendix D (for instance, at busy Class B
  airports)
- In Class B, C, D, and E surface areas below 10,000' MSL
- Only when requested by the pilots\*

Special VFR requires:

- Have an ATC clearance
- Maintain clear of clouds
- When _ground_ visibility is at least 1 statute mile, if reported
- If _flight_ visibility is at least 1 statute mile, if ground visibility is not
  reported
- At night, the pilot and airplane to be IFR certified

SVFR flights may be approved only if arriving and departing IFR aircraft are not
delayed.

<Reg part="91.157" />

<Footnotes>
  * The FAA wants pilots to know and understand the SVFR rules, and so they
  disallow controllers from suggesting it.
