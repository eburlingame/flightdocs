# Wind Shear

Wind shear is the change in wind speed and/or direction, usually in the
vertical. The characteristics of the wind shear profile are of critical
importance in determining the impact for an aircraft on takeoff or landing.

## Headwind-to-Tailwind Shear

When a headwind shears to a tailwind, there will be a sudden decrease in
airspeed and pitch attitude. In this situation, the remedy is to add power and
raise the nose.

## Tailwind-to-Headwind shear

When a tailwind shears to a headwind, there will be a sudden increase in
airspeed, causing an increase in pitch attitude. The usually reaction is to
reduce both pitch and power, which can lead to a dangerous low-speed, low-nose
configuration. This is dangerous if the aircraft suddenly experiences a
downdraft and a tailwind.
