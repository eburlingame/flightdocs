# Mountain Wave

Mountain wave or a lee wave is caused by wind blowing perpendicular to a
mountain range which causing standing waved to form on the downwind side.

Near the first trough of the wave, significant turbulent air will exist called
**rotor**.

With enough moisture, the crest of the wave will form almond-shaped lenticular
clouds.
