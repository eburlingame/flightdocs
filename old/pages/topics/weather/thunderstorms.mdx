# Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms pose a significant hazard to all aircraft. They are produced by a
cumulonimbus cloud, and always accompanied by lightning and thunder, usually
with strong gusts of wind, heavy rain, and sometimes with hail.

Thunderstorm ingredients:

1. Sufficient moisture
2. Unstable conditions
3. A lifting mechanism
   - For instance converging winds around surface lows and troughs, fronts,
     upslope flow, drylines, and local winds, such as sea breeze, lake breeze,
     land breeze, and valley breeze

## Stages of Thunderstorm

1. Towering cumulus stage
   - Characterized by strong convective updrafts
2. Mature stage
   - Begins when rain reaches the surface
   - Characterized by strong updrafts and downdrafts
3. Dissipating stage
   - Characterized by strong downdrafts

## Types of Thunderstorms

- Single cell thunderstorms
  - A single cloud forming into a single cell
  - Generally rare, most thunderstorms are multi-cell
- Multicell Thunderstorms
  - A cluster of cells, in different stages of development
  - New cells often form upwind of an existing cell as it develops and moves
    with the wind
- Supercell thunderstorms
  - Single, quasi-steady rotating updraft that persists for an extended period
    of time
  - Incredible damaging winds and hail are common
  - About 25 percent produce a tornado
