## Aircraft Information

### Powerplant

- Engine Manufacturer: Avco Lycoming
- Engine Model Number: 0-540-L3C5D
- Horsepower: 235
- Certificated Maximum Operating Altitude: 20,000 Ft

### Induction system

- Air induction
  - After passing through the turbocharger, the compressed air is ducted through
    the carburetor and induction manifold into the engine cylinders.
  - Heated intake air may be obtained from a shroud which covers the exhaust
    manifold located on the left side of the engine, controlled by the
    carburetor heat control
- Cooling
  - Cooling air is directed around the cylinders by baffling and through the
    remote oil cooler, then exhausted through cowl flaps on the lower edge of
    the cowling
  - Before starting the engine, throughout takeoff and high power operations,
    the cowl flap lever should be open to provide maximum cooling

### Turbocharger

<img src="/img/content/t182-turbocharger.png" />

- The exhaust manifold discharges the gas into the turbine section of the
  turbocharger.
- A waste gate incorporated into the exhaust manifold, controls the volume of
  gas flowing through the turbine by venting excess gas through a bypass.
- Exhaust gases drive the turbine which, in turn drives the compressor

> The compressor has the capability of producing manifold pressures in excess of
> 31 inHg. In order not to exceed the maximum, manifold pressure should be
> monitored closely and the throttle control adjusted as necessary to maintain
> 31 inHg.

Full open throttle control will not be necessary to maintain maximum continuous
power (31 in. Hg.), with the possible exception during hot day conditions at
high altitude.

- The turbocharged engine will react just the opposite of a normally aspirated
  engine when the RPM is varied:
  - When the RPM is **increased**, the manifold pressure will **increase**
    slightly
  - When the RPM is **decreased**, the manifold pressure will **decrease**
    slightly
- Manifold pressure will also change slightly with airspeed:
  - As airspeed is **increased**, the manifold pressure will **increase**
    slightly
  - As airspeed is **decreased**, the manifold pressure will **decrease**
    slightly
- Manifold pressure will also change with mixutre:
  - **Enrichening** the mixture will **increase** the manifold pressure
  - **Leaning** the mixture will **decrease** the manifold pressure

#### Overboosting

An inadvertent overboost of 2 to 3 inches of manifold pressure is not considered
detrimental to the engine as long as it is momentary. Immediate corrective
action is required when an overboost occurs.

### Propeller

Aircraft is equipped with a McCauley 3-blade, constant speed propeller.

The propeller's pitched is controlled by a propeller governor, which controls
flow of engine oil (boosted to high pressure by the governing pump) to or from a
piston in the propeller hub.

- Oil pressure acting on the piston twists the blades toward **high pitch** /
  **low RPM**.
- When this oil pressure is relieved, centrifugal force, assisted by an internal
  spring, twist the blades toward **low pitch** / ** high RPM**.

### Fuel

- 100LL Fuel
- Two wing fuel tanks, 46 gallons each. 92 gallons total
  - 88 gallons usable
- Fuel is delivered from the fuel system to the carburetor by gravity flow, the
  engine-driven fuel pump, and/or auxiliary fuel pump
- The fuel primer is a small pump which draws fuel from the fuel strainer when
  the plunger knob is pulled out, and injects it into the engine intake ports
  when the knob is pushed back in
- If a fuel tank quantity is completely exhausted in flight, it is recommended
  that the fuel selector valve be switched back to the BOTH position as this
  will allow some fuel from the fuller tank to transfer back through the
  selector valve to the empty tank

### Oil

- Sump: 8 quarts
- Total: 9 quarts (an additional quart in the oil filter)

### Engine Indications

- Tachometer
  - Normal operating range: 2100-2400 RPM, 2400RPM red line
- Manifold Pressure
  - Normal operating range: 17-25 inHg, 31 inHg red line

  - Normal operating range: 3.0 - 30.0 psi, 30.0 psi red line
- Oil pressure
  - Normal operating range: 60 - 90 psi, 115 psi red line

## Electrical System

The airplane is equipped with a **28-volt, direct-current** electrical system.

There are two buses:

- The primary bus, which operates the fuel pumps, lights, and ignition switch
- The avionics bus, which operates the radios and other avionics

The master switch is a split-rocker type switch labeled MASTER, and is ON in the
up position:

- The right half of the switch, labeled BAT, controls all electrical power to
  the airplane
- The left half, labeled ALT, controls the alternator

The ammeter, located between the fuel gages, indicates the amount of current, in
amperes, from the alternator to the battery or from the battery to the airplane
electrical system.

- In the event the alternator is not functioning or the electrical load exceeds
  the output of the alternator, the ammeter indicates a discharge
- There is also a LOW VOLTAGE indicator light on the right of the panel
- In the event of an over-voltage condition, the alternator will be
  automatically removed from the electrical system
  - The ammeter will then indicate a discharge from the battery
  - The alternator can be reset by cycling the master switch

## Weight Limits

- Max ramp weight: 3112 lbs
- Max takeoff weight: 3100 lbs
- Max landing weight: 2950 lbs

## Load Factor Limits

- Flight Load Factors:
  - Flaps Up: +3.8g, -1.52g
  - Flaps Down: +2.0g

The design load factors are 150% of the above, and in all cases, the structure
meets or exceeds design loads.

## Flap Limitations

- Approved Takeoff Range: 0° to 20°
- Approved Landing Range: 0° to FULL
