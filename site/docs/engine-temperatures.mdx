# Engine Temperatures

## Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT)

The cylinder head temperature (CHT) is the temperature of the cylinder head,
which measures heat expended during the power stroke.

High CHT can cause detonation, pre-ignition, and engine damage. High
temperatures indicate that the engine is under excessive load.

For most high-performance engines, the maximum CHT is around 400째F. Pilots
should take action to reduce CHT if it exceeds this value.

Things that can affect CHT include:

- Power setting
- Mixture
- Cooling airflow over the engine
- Cowl flags
- Timing, spark plug failures, and magneto problems

## Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)

The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is the temperature of the exhaust gases as
they leave the cylinder, which measures the heat expended during the exhaust
stroke.

This is an indication of the energy being wasted in the exhaust gases. High EGTs
do not pose a threat to the engine, but they do indicate that the engine is not
running efficiently.

### Leaning operations

Pilots can lean the mixture to reduce EGTs.

As a general rule, the best power mixture is around:

- 100째F rich of peak
- 20째F to 50째F lean of peak

## Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT)

On turbocharged engines, the turbine inlet temperatures measures the temperature
of the air before it enters the turbocharger turbine.
