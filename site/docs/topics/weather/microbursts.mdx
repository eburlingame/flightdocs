# Downbursts and Microbursts

Shower and thunderstorm cells sometimes produce intense downdrafts called
downbursts that create strong, often damaging winds. Smaller, shorter-lived
downbursts are called microbursts.

A downburst is especially dangerous to airplanes when it is encountered when
climbing from takeoff or approaching to land. During this phase, the aircraft is
operating at relatively slow speeds. A major change of wind velocity can lead to
loss of lift and a crash.
