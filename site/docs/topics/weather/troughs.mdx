# Troughs and Ridges

## Troughs

A trough is an area of low pressure, bounded by areas of high pressure of each
side.

Since the air in the trough cannot move outward due to high pressure at its
boundaries, nor can it descend into the ground, it is forced upwards. This
upward moving air is conducive to cloudiness and precipitation.

## Ridges

A ridge, or a ridge line, is an elongated area of high pressure. These are areas
of descending air, which dissipate cloudiness.
