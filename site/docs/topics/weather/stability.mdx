# Stability

The stability of the atmosphere is the property of the air to either enhance or
suppress the vertical motion of air parcels.

- In a stable atmosphere, a lifted parcel of air will be _cooler_ than the
  surrounding air, and thus is not prone to further upward movement.
- Likewise in an unstable atmosphere, a lifted parcel of air will be _warmer_
  than the surrounding air, and thus is prone to further upward movement.

## Associated Weather

Very generally, the stability of the atmosphere determines what kind of weather
is likely:
