# Fog

Fog forms when a small temperature-dewpoint spread exists.

## Radiation Fog

Radiation fog forms over land area when the Earth is cooled due to energy
radiating into space. This cooling reduces the air temperature the dewpoint or
below, and often occurs on clear, windless nights. Radiation fog is generally a
nighttime occurrence and often does not dissipate until after sunrise.

## Advection Fog

Advection fog forms when moist air moves over a colder surface. This is common
in coastal areas, where moist air from the water is blown onto the relatively
cool land.

Advection fog can move deep into continental land area. Strong winds can push
the fog into a layer of low stratus clouds.

## Upslope Fog

Upslope fog forms as a result of moist, stable air being adiabatically cooled to
or below its dewpoint as it moves up sloping terrain.

## Frontal Fog

When warm, moist air is lifted over a front, clouds and precipitation may form.
If the cold air below is near its dewpoint, evaporation (or sublimation) from
the precipitation may saturate the cold air and form fog.

## Steam Fog

When very cold air moves across relatively warm water, enough moisture may
evaporate from the water surface to produce saturation. As the rising water
vapor meets the cold air, it immediately recondenses and rises with the air that
is being warmed from below.

Because the air is destabilized, fog appears as rising filaments or streamers
that resemble steam.
