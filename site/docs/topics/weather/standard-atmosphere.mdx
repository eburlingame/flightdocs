# The Standard Atmosphere

The standard atmosphere is a fictitious set of atmospheric conditions which can
be used as a baseline for actual observations. The standard atmosphere is
defined by an average of condition throughout the atmosphere for all altitudes,
seasons, and latitudes.

At sea level, the standard atmosphere is **15&deg; C** and **29.92" Hg**. As you
ascend, the temperature lapses at approximately **2&deg; C per 1000 feet**.

This continues until the start of the tropopause, at around 36,000 feet.
