# Pilot Reports (PIREPs)

A PIREP is a pilot-issued report which describes weather at a given location at
a given time.

They can be standard (denoted `UA`), or urgent (denoted `UUA`).

They often contain height/bases of clouds, wind shear, turbulence, or icing.

They are reported in:

- Altitude MSL
- Visibilities in statute miles
- Distance nautical miles

## Contents of a PIREP

When giving a pilot report, be sure to include the following elements:

<Acronym>
  <AcronymRow letter="L" title="Location" notes="Location of your report" />
  <AcronymRow letter="A" title="Altitude" notes="Altitude of the report" />
  <AcronymRow letter="T" title="Time" notes="Time of the report in zulu time" />
  <AcronymRow letter="T" title="Type of aircraft" notes="E.g. C172, BE36" />
  <AcronymRow
    letter="O"
    title="Observation"
    notes="What you're observering. This could be wind, sky condition, cloud tops, turbulence, icing. Not every element need to be in your report."
  />
</Acronym>

## Solicitation of PIREPs by ATC

ATC will actually ask for PIREPs in certain weather conditions:

- Ceilings at or below 5,000 feet.
  - These PIREPs must include cloud bases, tops and cloud coverage when
    available.
  - Additionally, when providing approach control services, ensure that at least
    one descent/climb-out PIREP and other related phenomena is obtained each
    hour
- Visibility (surface or aloft) at or less than 5 miles
- Thunderstorms and related phenomena
- Turbulence of moderate degree or greater
- Icing of light degree or greater
- Wind shear
- Braking action reports
- Volcanic ash clouds
- Detection of sulfur gases (SO2 or H2S), associated with volcanic activity, in
  the cabin
