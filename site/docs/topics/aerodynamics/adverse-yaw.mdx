# Adverse Yaw

Adverse yaw is the tendency for an airplane to yaw in the opposite direction of
a bank. For example, if you roll to the right, you'll experience an adverse
yawing moment to the left.

This is because the lower wing (the inside wing) momentarily producing _less_
lift than it was previously. This decrease in lift also comes with a decrease in
induced drag, and the wing has a tendency to move forward.

Likewise the outside wing is momentarily producing _more_ lift, which causes an
increase in induced drag and "pulls" the wing backward.

## Counteracting Adverse Yaw

Most light airplanes are fitted with differential ailerons to counteract the
effects of adverse yaw. With these, the upward alerion travels further upward
than the downward aileron travels downward. This deceases the amount of drag
produced by the upward moving wing.

As always though, rudder input will still be required to coordinate the turn.
