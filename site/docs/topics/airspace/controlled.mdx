# Controlled Airspace

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classification
of airspace (Classâ€‰A through Class E airspace) and in which air traffic control
service is provided to IFR flights and to VFR flights.

Inside controlled airspace, controllers will provide safety alerts for:

- Terrain and obstructions, when an aircraft's altitude puts it in an unsafe
  proximity to terrain or obstructions
- Aircraft conflicts, when the controller controller observes another aircraft
  in an unsafe proximity
