# Turbocharging and Supercharging

A turbocharger is a device that increases the horsepower by compressing the
intake air before it enters the engine.

Turbocharging can be done in two ways:

- A **supercharger** relies on an engine-driven air pump or compressor
- A **turbocharger** relies on a turbine driven by the engine's exhaust gases

## Turbochargers

Turbochargers utilize a turbine which is powered by the engine's exhaust gases.
This turbine is used to drive a compressor which compresses the engine's intake
air, which allows the engine to burn more fuel and produce more power.

Since air density decreases with altitude, turbochargers can be used to get
sea-level-like performance at high altitudes.

### Components

- **Turbine**: Driven by the engine's exhaust gases
- **Compressor**: Connected to the turbine by a shaft, compresses the intake air
- **Wastegate**: Controls the boost pressure by limiting how much air bypasses
  the turbine
- **Intercooler**: Cools the compressed air before it enters the engine, only in
  some turbocharged engines

### Types of Turbochargers

- **Altitude turbocharging or turbonormalizing**: Used to maintain sea-level
  performance at high altitudes
- **Ground boosting**: Compresses intake air to pressures higher than sea level
  to increase power output

The type of turbocharging system depends on the engine's rating.

### Types of Wastegates

- **Automatic waste gate**: Uses a linkage to the throttle to control the boost
  pressure, or a engine-oil pressure actuator
- **Manual waste gate**: Controlled by a separate control in the cockpit
- **Fixed waste gates**: The waste gate is fixed to a certain bypass
  configuration. Care must be taken to ensure that the engine does not
  overboost.

### Overboosting

Overboosting occurs when the turbocharger produces more boost pressure than the
engine can handle. This can cause detotation and engine damage.

This can occur in a manual waste-gate system if the waste gate is not opened
while descending from a high altitude.

It is also important for engine oil to be at the correct temperature before
applying takeoff power. The turbine can spin as high as 80,000 RPM, so the
bearings in the system must be continuously lubricated by engine oil.

### Critical Altitude

The critical altitude is the altitude at which the turbocharger can no longer
maintain sea-level-like performance. This is the point at which the turbine can
no longer compress the air to sea-level density.
