# Manifold Pressure

On aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller, power output is controlled
by the throttle and indicated by a manifold pressure gauge. The gauge measures
the absolute pressure of the fuel-air mixture inside the intake manifold and is
more correctly a measure of **manifold absolute pressure (MAP)**.

- When the engine is not running, the manifold pressure gauge will read
  approximately ambient pressure.
- When the engine is started, the manifold pressure indication decreases to a
  value less than ambient pressure (i.e., idle at 12 "Hg)
- Engine failure or power loss is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase
  in manifold pressure to a value corresponding to the ambient air pressure at
  the altitude where the failure occurred.

### MAP and RPM

For any given rpm, there is a manifold pressure that should not be exceeded. If
manifold pressure is excessive for a given rpm, the pressure within the
cylinders could be exceeded, placing undue stress on the cylinders.

- When **lowering power**, reduce throttle first, then adjust propeller pitch to
  maintain rpm.
- When **increasing power**, adjust propeller RPM first, then increase throttle
  to maintain rpm.

For a given rpm, the manifold pressure should be set to the value specified in
the aircraft's operating handbook.
