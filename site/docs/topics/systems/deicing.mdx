# Anti-Ice and Deice Systems

Anti-icing equipment is designed to prevent the formation of ice, while deicing
equipment is designed to remove ice once it has formed.

## Deicing Boots

Inflatable deicing boots consist of a rubber sheet bonded to the leading edge of
the airfoil. When ice builds up on the leading edge, an engine-driven pneumatic
pump inflates the rubber boots. Many turboprop aircraft divert engine bleed air
to the wing to inflate the rubber boots.

## Propeller Anti-Ice

Propellers are protected from icing by the use of alcohol or electrically heated
element.

## Windscreen Anti-Ice

One window anti-ice system system directs a flow of alcohol to the windscreen.
If used early enough, the alcohol prevents ice from building up on the
windscreen. The rate of alcohol flow can be controlled by a dial in the flight
deck according to procedures recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

Another effective method of anti-icing equipment is the electric heating method.
Small wires or other conductive material is imbedded in the windscreen. The
heater can be turned on by a switch in the flight deck, causing an electrical
current to be passed across the shield through the wires to provide sufficient
heat to prevent the formation of ice on the windscreen.
