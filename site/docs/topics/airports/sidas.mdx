# Security Identification Display Area (SIDA)

Security Identification Display Areas (SIDA) are limited access areas that
require a badge issued in accordance with procedures in 49 CFR Part 1542. A SIDA
can include the Air Operations Area (AOA), e.g., aircraft movement area or
parking area, or a Secured Area, such as where commercial passengers enplane.
The AOA may not be a SIDA, but a Secured Area is always a SIDA. Movement through
or into a SIDA is prohibited without authorization and proper identification
being displayed.
