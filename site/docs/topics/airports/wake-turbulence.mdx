# Wake Turbulence Avoidance

Every aircraft generates wake turbulence while in flight. Wake turbulence is a
function of an aircraft producing lift, resulting in the formation of two
counter-rotating vortices trailing behind the aircraft.

Since the turbulence from a “dirty” aircraft configuration hastens wake decay,
the greatest vortex strength occurs when the generating aircraft is:

- Heavy
- Clean
- Slow

## Avoidance

- Landing behind a larger aircraft on the same runway or parallel runway:
  - Stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path-note its
    touchdown point-land beyond it.
- Landing behind a departing larger aircraft on the same or parallel runway:
  - Note the larger aircraft's rotation point and land well prior to rotation
    point.
- Departing behind a larger aircraft:
  - Note the larger aircraft's rotation point, and rotate prior to that point.
  - Climb above the aircraft's climb path and turn clear of the wake when able.
- Departing or landing after a larger aircraft executing a low approach, missed
  approach, or touch-and-go landing:
  - You should ensure that an interval of at least 2 minutes has elapsed before
    your takeoff or landing.

> In summary, land beyond the touchdown point of a large aircraft, and takeoff
> before the rotation point of the larger aircraft.
