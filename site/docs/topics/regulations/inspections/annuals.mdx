# Annual Inspections

An annual inspection is required every **12 months** (to the last day of the
month issued), and must be performed by an A&P with Inspection Authorization
(IA).

A record of the annual inspection should be included in the aircraft's logbook.

If an aircraft's inspection date has passed, it must receive a
[Special Flight Permit](/topics/regulations/inspections/sfps) to fly to a place
where the inspection can be performed. All applicable ADs must be adhered to
before the flight, however.
