# Aircraft Right-of-Way Rules

As always, when weather permits aircraft shall see and avoid other aircraft
(under VFR or IFR).

1. An aircraft in distress has the right-of-way over all other air traffic.
2. When aircraft of the same category are converging at approximately the same
   altitude (except head-on), the aircraft to the **other's right has the
   right-of-way**
   - A balloon has the right-of-way over any other category of aircraft
   - A glider has the right-of-way over an airship, powered parachute,
     weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, or rotorcraft
   - An airship has the right-of-way over a powered parachute,
     weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, or rotorcraft
3. An aircraft towing or refueling other aircraft has the right-of-way over all
   other engine-driven aircraft (this could be a glider on tow)
4. When aircraft are approaching each other head-on, or nearly so, each pilot of
   each aircraft shall alter course to the right
5. Each aircraft that is being overtaken has the right-of-way and each pilot of
   an overtaking aircraft shall alter course to the right to pass well clear.
6. During landing:

   - Aircraft, while on final approach to land or while landing, have the
     right-of-way over other aircraft in flight or operating on the surface.
     - You shall not take advantage of this rule to force an aircraft off the
       runway surface which has already landed and is attempting to make way for
       an aircraft on final approach.
   - When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of
     landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way
     - You shall not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another
       which is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft.
