# Approved Flight Manual

Approved Flight Manuals (AFMs) is a handbook designed as an operating guide for
the aircraft. It includes normal and Emergency operating procedures, speeds, and
limitations. It must meet the criteria set forth in <Reg part="21.5" />.

All aircraft manufactured after March 1, 1979 are required to have an AFM.

For aircraft under 6,000 pounds that do no have an AFM, the relevant information
can be found in a combination of:

- Approved manual materials (such as the Pilots Operating Handbook)
- Placards
- Markings

Which all must be in the aircraft at all times.
