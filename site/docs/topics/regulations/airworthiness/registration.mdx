# Registration Certificate

Each aircraft is required to be registered with the FAA Aircraft Registry. The
Certificate of Aircraft Registration is proof of this registration and must be
kept in the aircraft at all times.

Registration certificates expire **3 years** after being issued (to the last of
the month they were issued).

If you have applied to renew your registration, the registration application
must be carried in the aircraft as proof of registration. This temporary
registration is good for **90 days** after submitting the applications.
