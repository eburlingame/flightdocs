# Dropping Objects from Aircraft

No pilot in command of a civil aircraft may allow any object to be dropped from
that aircraft in flight that creates a hazard to persons or property. However,
this section does not prohibit the dropping of any object if reasonable
precautions are taken to avoid injury or damage to persons or property.
