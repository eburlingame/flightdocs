# High-Altitude Operations

## High Altitude Equipment

At an altitude of 18,000 feet, the density of the air has one-half the density
of air at sea level.

For flights at and above 24,000 ft. MSL (FL240) where you are using VORs as a
primary means of navigation, you must also have a DME or RNAV system
installed.\*

  \* This applies to U.S.-registered civil aircraft within the 50 states and the
  District of Columbia.

## Supplemental Oxygen Requirements

### In an Unpressurized Airplane

- At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,500 feet (MSL) up to and including 14,000
  feet (MSL):
  - The required minimum flight crew is provided with and uses supplemental
    oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than
    30 minutes duration
- At cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet (MSL) up to and including 15,000
  feet (MSL):
  - The required minimum flight crew is provided with and uses supplemental
    oxygen during the entire flight time at those altitudes
- At cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet (MSL):
  - Each occupant of the aircraft is provided with supplemental oxygen
  - Note they passengers are not required to use the oxygen, but it must be
    provided

### In a Pressurized Airplane

- No person may operate a civil aircraft of U.S. registry with a pressurized
  cabin:
  - At flight altitudes above flight level 250: unless at least a 10-minute
    supply of supplemental oxygen is available for each occupant of the aircraft
    for use in the event that a descent is necessitated by loss of cabin
    pressurization
  - At flight altitudes above flight level 350: unless one pilot at the controls
    of the airplane is wearing and using an oxygen mask that is secured and
    sealed and that either supplies oxygen at all times or automatically
    supplies oxygen whenever the cabin pressure altitude of the airplane exceeds
    14,000 feet (MSL), except that the one pilot need not wear and use an oxygen
    mask while at or below flight level 410 if there are two pilots at the
    controls and each pilot has a quick-donning type of oxygen mask that can be
    placed on the face with one hand from the ready position within 5 seconds,
    supplying oxygen and properly secured and sealed.
- If for any reason at any time it is necessary for one pilot to leave the
  controls of the aircraft when operating at flight altitudes above flight level
  350, the remaining pilot at the controls shall put on and use an oxygen mask
  until the other pilot has returned to that crewmember's station.
