# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)

The airspeed indicator displays an approximation of the aircraft's airspeed,
based on the difference between pitot pressure and the static pressure.

## Errors

- Position errors
  - Errors caused by erroneous pressure from the static port, usually caused by
    a specific flight attitude or configuration
- Density errors
  - The instrument is not corrected for nonstandard temperature or pressure,
    including the effects of altitude
- Compressibility errors
  - At high speeds, the packing of air into the pitot tube can result in higher
    than normal readings. At low airspeed this is not significant
