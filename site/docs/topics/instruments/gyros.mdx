# Gyroscopic Instruments

Gyroscopic instruments operate using one or more gyroscopes, which are fixed in
space along a certain axis.

The instruments are usually operated by a vacuum system in the airplane. This
vacuum draws air over baffle and spins the gyro.

Some gyroscopic instruments are electrically powered. For instance, the turn
coordinator is often electrically powered to provide redundant bank information
in the event of a vacuum system failure.
