# Magnetic Compass

The magnetic compass contains a compass card attached to a magnetized needle,
which is housed in a liquid.

## Errors

- Oscillation errors: Erratic movement of the card caused my turbulence or rough
  control inputs
- Deviation errors: Errors caused by the magnetics fields produced by equipment
  in the aircraft
  - Corrected by the calibration on the compass card
- Variation errors: Error caused by the difference between true and magnetic
  north
  - Corrected by isogonic lines
- Dip errors
  - Acceleration errors: On east or west heading, the compass will show a
    momentary turn to the north when accelerating, and to the sound when
    decelerating.
    - **A**ccelerate
    - **N**orth
    - **D**ecelerate
    - **S**outh
  - Northerly turning errors: On north or south headings, the compass will lead
    in the north half of the turn, and lag in the south half of the turn.
    - **U**ndershoot
    - **N**orth
    - **O**vershoot
    - **S**outh
