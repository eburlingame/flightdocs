# Pitot-Static Instruments

Pitot-static usually include the altimeter, airspeed indicator, and vertical
speed indicator. They operate using differences in the pressure of air coming
from the static port and/or the pitot tube.

## Alternate Static Source

Some airplanes are equipped with an alternate static source, which is often
vented into the cockpit. This is used in case of an external static port
blockage.

When an alternate static source is used:

- Airspeed Indicator: Will read **greater** actual airspeed
- Altimeter **Higher** than actual altitude
- Vertical Speed Indicator: Show a momentary climb, then stable
