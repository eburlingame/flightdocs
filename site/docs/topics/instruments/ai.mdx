# Attitude Indicator (AI)

The attitude indicate provide pitch and bank information to the pilot.

Standard vacuum-driven attitude indicators rely on a gyroscope mounted in the
horizontal plane. When he aircraft is pitched or banked, the spinning gyroscope
stays rigid in space.

Most attitude indicators are accurate to +/- 100&deg; of bank, and 60-70&deg; of
pitch. Beyond this, the gyro will tumble.

Some modern AI's will never tumble.
