# Welcome to FlightDocs

FlightDocs aims to be an open-source repository of pilot information and reference material that is usually taught as part of pilot ground schools. On this site you'll find a variety of pages with concise explanations about aircraft systems, the national airspace system, weather, and pilot regulations.

If you find something missing or inaccurate, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/eburlingame/flightdocs/issues). Or even better, submit a pull request to update the content.
