# Forces During Flight

## Forces in Straight-and-Level Flight

- In straight and level, unaccelerated flight all forces are equal

## Forces in a Climb

- The lift vector is a acting rearward and
- Greater thrust is required to balance the forces

## Forces in a Dive

![Forces in a dive](images/image-19.png)

- Consider an aircraft pulling out of a dive:
  - Because a high momentum downward in a dive, rapid changes in pitch will result in a big difference between the aircraft's flight path (downward) and it's pitch angle (less downward), leading to a high angle of attack and a stall
  - Pulling out of a dive slowly allows the flight path to change slowly with the relative wind, keeping the angle of attack small

## Forces in a Turn

![Forces in a turn](images/forces-in-turn.jpg)

- Because a portion of the lift produced by the wing is being used to accelerate the aircraft in the direction of the turn, more lift is required to maintain the same altitude

![Load factor in a turn](images/turn-load-factor.jpg)

The load factor of an airplane in a level turn is given by:

$$
\text{load factor} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}, \text{where } \theta = \text{bank angle}
$$

## Load Factor

- Load factor is caused by accelerating the airplane in the vertical direction

### Maneuvering Speed and Vg Diagrams

Maneuvering speed is the speed at which the aircraft will stall before exceeding its load factor limit, if it encounters a sudden increase in angle of attack.

![Vg Diagram](images/image-22.png)

- Consider an airplane flying at a constant airspeed when it encounters a sudden updraft:
  - The relative wind changes the angle of attack, and the wing will instantaneously produce 2x or 3x times the amount of lift
  - This increases lift accelerates the airplane upward, inducing load on the airplane
  - Because this increase in lift is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the faster the airplane goes the more load factor a given gust can induce
  - Maneuvering speed is set at the point at which the wing will stall (exceed the critical angle of attack) before it can impart a load factor greater than the load factor limit (for instance, +3.8g for a the normal category)
- Maneuvering speed allows for full control deflection of a single control surface
- Maneuvering speed increases with weight

  - The heavier the airplane, the more control input will be required to induce a given load factor. So the aircraft will run out of control authority before it can impart too much load factor
