## Additional Training Requirements ([61.31](/_references/14-CFR/61.31))

- Pilots who already hold a certificate, but want to fly another category or class can either get a certificate for that category, or receive training and an endorsement from an instructor
  - Note this doesn't have an expiration like the student pilot 90-day solo requirement

## Knowledge Tests ([61.35](/_references/14-CFR/61.35))

- Knowledge test are required for initial ratings
- If a pilot holds a powered rating (airplane, helicopter), but wants to get an unpowered category rating (glider, balloon) -> no knowledge test is required
- An unpowered pilot wanting to get a powered category rating, will require a knowledge test

## Prerequisites for practical tests ([61.39](/_references/14-CFR/61.39))

  - Name of the safety pilot, if required
- The sole manipulator of the controls can log PIC time
  - A second pilot can concurrently _log_ PIC time if they are required for the operation of the aircraft (like a A/C that requires 2 crew members), or if the regulations require it (like a safety pilot)

## Medical Deficiencies ([61.53](/_references/14-CFR/61.53))

- If you know of a medical condition that would made you unable to meed the medical requirements, even if your current medical is still valid
