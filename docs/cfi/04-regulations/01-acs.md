# Airmen Certification Standards (ACS)

## ACS

- Unlike the PTS, each ACS has three components for each topic:
  - Knowledge
  - Risk Management
  - Skills
- Examiners usually ask a single item from the risk management, then all the skills
- ACS have standards areas for the written tests and the practical tests
