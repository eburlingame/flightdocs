- Takeoffs and landings, including normal and crosswind
- Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions
- Climbs and climbing turns
- Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures
- Collision avoidance, windshear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance
- Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations
- Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight
- Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery:
  - initiated at the first indication of a stall, and
  - recovery from a full stall
- Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions
- Ground reference maneuvers
- Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions
- Slips to a landing
- Go-arounds
- If the airplane cannot do the given maneuver, it is not required

  - Use of aircraft performance charts pertaining to cross-country flight
  - Use of aeronautical weather reports and forecasts
  - Emergency procedures
  - Traffic pattern procedures that include area departure, area arrival, entry into the traffic pattern, and approach
  - Collision avoidance, wake turbulence precautions, and windshear avoidance
  - Recognition of hazardous terrain features in the geographical area where the cross-country flight will be flown
  - Procedures for operating all the instruments and equipment installed in the aircraft
  - Use of radios for VFR navigation and two-way communication
  - Takeoff, approach, landing procedures; short-field, soft-field, and crosswind takeoffs, approaches, and landings
