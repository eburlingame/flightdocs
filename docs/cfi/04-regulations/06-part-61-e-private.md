## Pilot looking to add a class rating

A pilot looking to add a category or class rating, for instance a multi-engine pilot adding a single-engine private:

- Look at [61.63(c)](/_references/14-CFR/61.63), which implies:
  - To fly solo they need the [AC 61-65 A.72](/_references/AC-61-65/A.72) endorsement
    - This endorsement does not expire, unless an expiry is added by the instructor
  - There's no hourly requirements, XC requirements, or night requirements
  - No student pilot limitation (25nm, 50nm airports, Class B flight)
  - For the practical test, they will only need to demonstrate what's on the task matrix
