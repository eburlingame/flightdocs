# Flight Instruction Techniques

## Integrated Flight Instruction 

> Flight instruction which emphasizes airplane control using outside visual references and instrument references.

- Introduce all flight maneuvers with both outside reference and instrument references
- For this to be effective, instrument reference should be introduced with the first maneuvers
- Instill good "see and avoid" habit from the start of training
