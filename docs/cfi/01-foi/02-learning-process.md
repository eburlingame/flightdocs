- Based on this theory is simple "carrot-and-stick" approach to learning

## Cognitive Theory

- Focuses on what's going on inside the mind

### Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

- Higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), also called aeronautical decision-making (ADM)
- Based on the last three of Bloom's Taxonomy (Synthesis, evaluation, knowledge)
- Progress learning from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract

## Scenario-Based Training  (SBT)

- Use of structured, "real-world" scenarios to approach flight-training objectives
- Helps student's "make meaning" out of their past experiences, and use that to strengthen their ADM
