# Risk Management

## PAVE Checklist

Use before every flight:

- **P**: Pilot
- **A**: Aircraft
- **V**: EnVironment
- **E**: External pressures

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 1-4](/_references/AIH/1-4)

## IMSAFE Checklist

IMSAFE is used to evaluate aeromedical factors that may affect a pilot.

- **I**: Illness
- **M**: Medication
- **S**: Stress
- **A**: Alcohol
- **F**: Fatigue
- **E**: Emotion

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 1-7](/_references/AIH/1-7)

## Flight Risk Assessment Tools (FRAT)

A flight risk assessment tool is a numerical decision-making framework for visualization and aggregating risk into a go/no-go decision.

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 1-10](/_references/AIH/1-10)

## Situation Awareness

Situational awareness is continuous awareness of all factors and conditions that affect aircraft safety before, during, and after flight.

Some obstacles to situational awareness are:

- Fatigue
- Stress
- Complacency: Overconfidence from previous experience or expectation
- Fixation: Fixating on one issue and ignoring others, especially true with advanced avionics

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 1-13](/_references/AIH/1-13)

## Single-Pilot Resource Management

The art and science of managing all of the resources available to a single pilot to ensure a successful outcome.

This includes concepts like:

- Aeronautical decision-making
- Situational awareness
- Risk management
- Task management
- Automation management
- Controlled flight into terrain awareness (CFIT)

### CARE Checklist

- C: Consequences
- A: Alternatives
- R: Reality
- E: External pressures

### The 5Ps

1. The Plan: What is the plan and how can it change
2. The Pilot: Readiness, fatigue, currency, proficiency
3. The Plane: Condition of the plane, engine, avionics
4. The Passengers: Single-pilot will need to deal with passengers directly, their pressures or fears
5. The Programming: Instruments, GPS, automation

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 1-16](/_references/AIH/1-16)

## Aeronautical Decision-Making

ADM is systemic approach to evaluating a situation and consistently determining the best course of action.

### Hazardous Attitudes

Pilots should actively recognize their own hazardous attitudes, but instructors should also be aware of any hazardous attitudes of their learners.

- Anti-authority: "Don't tell me" / "Taking chances is foolish"
- Impulsivity: "Do it quickly" / "Follow the rules. They are usually right"
- Invulnerability: "It won't happen to me" / "It could happen to me"
  - Or, "it might just happen to me"
- Macho: "I can do it" / "Not so fast. Think first"
  - Don't compare yourself for others
- Resignation: "What's the use" / "I'm not helpless. I can make a difference"

Have pilots identify themselves with one or more of the attitudes, which may not happen all the time.
