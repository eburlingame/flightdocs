# The Teaching Process

### The Teaching Process

Teaching is the process of organizing and presenting material in such a way that a learner can understand it.

The four basic steps are:

1. Preparation
2. Presentation
3. Application
4. Assessment

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-1](/_references/AIH/5-1)

### Essential Skills

1. People skills: Use effective communication, listen
2. Subject matter expertise: Be an expert in the field that you're teaching
3. Management skills: Plan, lead, organize, supervise
4. Assessment skills: Effective evaluation of student progress

## Course of Training

A curriculum or training plan designed for the attainment of a specific goal, like a rating or certificate.

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-4](/_references/AIH/5-4)

## Preparation of a Lesson

### Objective and Standards

Determining the objective of a lesson should precede.

Two types of objectives:

- Performance-based: Reasonable, measurable standards from which a learner can be judged
  - Can be used to determine when to move to the next stage of instruction
- Decision-based: Evaluate pilot judgement and risk management
  - Used to teach topics like cross-country flying, emergency procedures, ADM

### Importance of the ACS

- The ACS/PTS is carefully designed with
  - Specific _content_ that closely mimics real flying skills
  - Specific _criteria_ that are reflective of acceptable standards
- An instructor should evaluate maneuvers based on the ACS performance standards, but present them in an appropriate scenario

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-6](/_references/AIH/5-6)

## Organization of Materials

Basic lesson structure:

- Introduction
  - Attention: Tell a story, tell a joke, get students' attention
  - Motivation: Explain why lesson material is important
  - Overview: Give an overview about what will be covered
- Development, main part of lesson
  - Past to present: Present material chronologically
  - Simple to complex: Start with basics, omit unneeded complexities
  - Known to unknown: Use what a learner already knows as a point of departure
  - Most frequency to least frequently used: Start with the most used skills or knowledge
- Conclusion
  - Quick wrap-up with a recap

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-9](/_references/AIH/5-9)

## Delivery Methods

### Lecture method

- Be prepared
- Use suitable language
- Use extemporaneous delivery
- Pros/cons
  - Good for background information
  - Good for large groups
  - Requires speaking skill

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-10](/_references/AIH/5-10)

### Discussion method

- Additional discussion to a lecture
- Discussion can be instructor-learner or learner-learner
- Good for engaging higher-order thinking skills from the materials

### Guided discussion method

- Instructor directs the discussion along a certain path
- Questions
  - Use lead-off questions to open an area for discussion
  - Use follow-up questions to continue the discussion

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-13](/_references/AIH/5-13)

## Cooperative or Group Learning

- Organize learners into small groups and have them work together
- Requires active participation and social skills
- Conditions
  - Use small, heterogenous groups
  - Give clear instructions or objectives
  - Recognition for group success
  - Sufficient time for learning

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-21](/_references/AIH/5-21)

## Demonstration-Performance Method

Learners observe a skill, then try to reproduce it.

1. Explanation phase: Convey precisely what we're trying to do
2. Demonstration phase: Demonstrate the actions necessary
3. Learner performance: Have the learner perform the actions, coaching as needed, evaluating
4. Evaluation phase: Instructor identifies how well the skill was learned

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-21](/_references/AIH/5-21)

## Drill and Practice

- Student learn by applying what they have been taught
- This requires repeated practice to apply their skills

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-22](/_references/AIH/5-22)

## Problem-Based Learning

A technique which gives learners complex, realistic, open-ended problems to solve.

- Motivates learning because problems are realistic
- Require learners to make decisions
- Not a single correct answer
- Should be connected to previous knowledge
- Requires critical thinking

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-16](/_references/AIH/5-16)

## Electronic Learning

- E-learning has many advantages:
  - Time flexible
  - Low cost
  - Easily updatable
  - Self-paced
- Disadvantages
  - Lack of peer interaction
  - Lack of personalized feedback

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 5-18](/_references/AIH/5-18)

## Instructional Aids / Training Technologies

An instructional aids are any devices or props that help the instructor.

- Theory
  - Use carefully selected charts, graphs, or visual aids
  - Cover key points and concepts
  - Straightforward and factual
  - Relatively simple is best
- Reasons for user
  - Can help hold learner's attention, like an engaging AV component
  - Can help reduce language or learning barriers
  - Can help instruction occur faster
- Guidelines
  - Plan ahead
  - Support a clear lesson objective
  - Build on previous learning
  - Appeal to learners
  - Check aids for completeness and accuracy
- Types
  - Dry erase board
  - Printed materials
  - Enhanced training materials, like custom syllabi or checklists
  - Projected materials
  - Video
  - Interactive systems
  - Computer-assisted learning
  - Mockups, models, cut-aways
