# Airspace: Definitions

## Objective

Understand the purpose of the National Airspace System, the 5 classes of airspace, and how they are shown on a sectional chart.

## Motivation

Flying in the National Airspace System is an important component of flight planning and a consideration for almost every flight. A pilot needs to know what airspace they are in and what are the requirements for flying in each of the different kinds of airspace.

## Timings

45 minutes

## Format

- Whiteboard / EFB

## Elements

- Why do have airspace?
  - Separation of airborne traffic
  - Facilitates efficient flow of aircraft
  - Denotes what level of air traffic control services are required
- Class Airspace
  - Controlled airspace: Class A, B, C, D, E
  - Uncontrolled airspace: Class G
  - Special use airspace: Various kinds
- Identifying classes of airspace
  - Class A airspace: 18,000' and above, not charted
  - Class B airspace: Busiest airports in the U.S.
    - Sectional: KSEA
    - Upsidedown wedding cake
  - Class C: Around other busy airports
    - Sectional: KPDX, KNUW
    - Inner ring, outer ring
  - Class D: Around busy regional airports
    - Sectional: KSLE, KSBP
  - Class E: IFR protection
    - Starts at surface: KAST
    - Starts at 700': KTDO
    - Starts at 1200': West of KHQM
    - Starts at 14,500': East of KJTC, blue shaded cutout
    - Above 60,000' (not charted)
  - Class G: Uncontrolled airspace
    - Everything else
- Knowledge check: What airspace are we in from the surface up to 18,000?
  - Over KSBP:
    - Surface to 2700' MSL: Class D
    - 2700' to 18,000' Class E
  - NW of KSBP
    - Surface to 18,000' Class E
  - Morro Bay, NW of KSBP
    - Surface to 700' AGL: Class G
    - 700' AGL to 18,000': Class E
  - Challenge: Over KRNT
    - Surface to 2500': Class D
    - 2500' to 3000': Class E
    - 3000' to 10,000': Class B
    - 10,000 to 18,000': Class E
