# Airspace: Entry Requirements

## Objective

Identify airspace on a sectional chart and determine the requirements for entering that given airspace.

## Motivation

Different classes of airspace have different entry requirements and provide different level of services to aircraft. We need to know the entry requirements for each class before flying into them.

## Timings

45 minutes

## Format

- Whiteboard / EFB

## Elements

- Class A airspace
  - Instrument rating
  - IFR flight plan
  - IFR clearance
  - Separation services provided
- Class B airspace
  - Explicit ATC clearance
    - "N549SR cleared in the Class B, maintain 3000"
  - Separation services provided
  - ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required within the Mode C veil
    - Sectional: KSEA mode C veil
- Class C airspace
  - Have their own approach/departure control
  - Two-way radio communication required for entry
    - Reference your aircraft by your callsign
    - "N549SR, Portland Tower." - sufficient
    - "Aircraft calling, standby" - not sufficient for entry
  - Separation provided between VFR and IFR traffic (not VFR/VFR)
  - ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required within and above the airspace
- Class D airspace
  - Two-way radio required for entry:
    - Same callsign requirements as Class C
  - Separation and sequencing provided for VFR traffic
  - No ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required
  - Some ATCTs are part-time
    - When the tower is closed the airspace reverts to Class E or Class G (chart supplement will say "Other times Class G")
- Class E airspace
  - No entry requirements for VFR
  - No separation services for VFR traffic
  - Can receive ATC services (IFR, VFR flight following)
  - Need ADS-B and Mode C transponder above 10,000' MSL
- Knowledge check
  - Flying into Portland Class C airspace, what do we need?
  - Flying into Seattle Class B airspace, what do we need?
  - Flying at 16,000' VFR and we need to climb due to weather, what should we be aware of?

## Questions

- You are looking to transition KPDX's airspace at 3000' MSL. You call Portland Tower and ask for a northbound transition.
  - They reply "N12382, standby." Are you cleared to enter the airspace?
  - What if they reply "Aircraft calling, standby?"
- What's the meaning of the `*L` on a airport block?
- What about the star symbol next to 124.4?
- You are flying an airplane with no transponder or ADS-B equipment. You plan to make a flight to the Eugene airport for some repairs.
  - Are you able to land there? Do you need to make any prior arrangements?
