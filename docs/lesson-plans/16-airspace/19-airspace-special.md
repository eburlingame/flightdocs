# Airspace: Special-Use Airspace

## Objective

Identify special use airspace on a chart and describe their limitations and entry requirements. Also understand chart publication frequencies and effective dates.

## Motivation

There is a large collection of special-use airspace (SUA), which supplements the basic classes of airspace. This airspace is used to protect special activities on the ground or in the air. Pilots need to to know which airspace they are allowed to operate in or through.

## Timings

45 minutes

## Format

- Whiteboard / EFB

  - Numbering system
    - IR1206: Four digits means no segment above 1,500' AGL
    - IR207: Three digits means one or more segments above 1,500' AGL

  - KAZO
- Special Flight Rules Area
  - Sectional: Washington D.C. (KDCA), Grand Canyon (KGCN), Pearson (KVUO)
  - D.C. SFRA requires completion of an online course
  - More information in 14 CFR Part 93

### Currency of Publications

- Aeronautical charts are published every 56 days
- Effective and expiration days are listed on the chart

## Questions

- Your flight plan will take you over a military operation area (MOA). Where can you find information about whether it's active? If it is active, can you still fly through it?
- You hear on the news that the president is visiting town on Saturday, the same day you were planning to fly. What would be sure to check before you depart?
- You're planning a scenic flight over the Grand Canyon. Where would you find information about the flight operations allowed there?
- Your flight has you cross this military training route VR1084. Where would you expect to find military aircraft along that route?
