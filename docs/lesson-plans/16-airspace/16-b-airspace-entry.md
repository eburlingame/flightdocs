# Airspace: Entry Requirements

## Objectives

Understand the entry requirements for each class of airspace.

## Motivations

## Timings

45 minutes

## Format

- Whiteboard / EFB

## Elements

- Class A airspace
  - Instrument rating
  - IFR flight plan
  - IFR clearance
  - Separation services provided
- Class B airspace
  - IFR flight plan and clearance
  - Explicit ATC clearance
    - "N549SR cleared in the Class B, maintain 3000"
  - Separation services provided
  - ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required within the Mode C veil
    - Sectional: KSEA mode C veil
- Class C airspace
  - Have their own approach/departure control
  - Two-way radio communication required for entry
    - Reference your aircraft by your callsign
    - "N549SR, Portland Tower." - sufficient
    - "Aircraft calling, standby" - not sufficient for entry
  - Separation provided between VFR and IFR traffic (not VFR/VFR)
  - ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required within and above the airspace
- Class D airspace
  - Two-way radio required for entry:
    - Same callsign requirements as Clasc C
  - Separation and sequencing provided for VFR traffic
  - No ADS-B Out + Mode C transponder required
  - Some ATCTs are part-time
    - When the tower is closed the airspace reverts to Class E or Class G (chart supplement will say "Other times Class G")
- Class E airspace
  - No entry requirements for VFR
  - No separation services for VFR traffic
  - Can receive ATC services (IFR, VFR flight following)
  - Need ADS-B and Mode C transponder above 10,000' MSL
- Knowledge check
  - Flying into Portland Class C airspace, what do we need?
  - Flying into Seattle Class B airspace, what do we need?
  - Flying at 16,000' VFR and we need to climb due to weather, what should we be aware of?
