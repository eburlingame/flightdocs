# Lift, Drag, and Airfoils

## Objective

To understand basic aerodynamic concepts like lift, drag, and the nomenclature we use to describe it.

## Motivation

Forms foundational knowledge for more advanced aerodynamic topics and provides a useful mental model for pilots so they can better anticipate and understand the operation of an airplane.

## Timing

1 hour

## Format

- [White board](/slides/lift-and-drag.pdf)

## Elements

### Basics

- Airplane components [Airport diagram]
  - Fuselage
  - Wings
  - Ailerons
  - Elevator
  - Horizontal stabilizer
  - Rudder
  - Vertical stabilizer
  - Empennage: Entire tail
- Newton's laws of motion [List]
  1. Momentum
  2. Fnet = mass \* acceleration
  3. Equal and opposite reaction
- Four forces of flight [Force diagram]
  - Lift
  - Weight
  - Thrust
  - Drag
- Lift theories
  - Newton: Barn door / hand in the wind [Barn door force]
    - Equal and opposite reaction
  - Bernoulli [Constricted tube]
    - Pressure in a tube constricted in the middle
    - Pressure is lower in the faster air in the middle
- Basic airfoil [Chord vs camber lines]
  - Chord line
  - Mean camber line
- Lift on an airfoil
  - Newton [Wing with rear/up force]
    - Air deflected downward causes for up and back
  - Bernoulli [Wing with stream tubes]
    - Stream tubes get condensed on the top of the wing
    - Lower pressure induces a force
- Angle of attack [Angle of attack + relative wind]
  - Chord line vs relative wind
  - Difference between _flight path_ and _relative wind_
  - Where momentum wants to take vs where the wing is pointed
- Lift equation

$$
\text{lift} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S C_l}{2}
$$

$$
\text{Where:}\\
\rho = \text{air density}\\
V = \text{velocity}\\
S = \text{surface area}\\
C_l = \text{coefficient of lift}
$$

- Critical angle of attack
  - Coefficient of lift vs angle of attack (Cl vs AoA) [Graph]
  - Critical angle of attack
  - Stall, turbulent airflow, detaching of the boundary layer [Stall and wing]
- Flight at slow airspeeds [Two airplanes, high vs low speed with AoA]
  - To maintain level flight as we slow: increase AoA

### Pitching Moment

- Basic torque
  - See-saw
  - 1 lbs 2 feet away vs 2 lbs 1 foot away
- Center of pressure vs center of gravity [Force diagram]
  - Cl should always be behind Cg
- Elevator downforce

### Thrust and Drag

- Thrust vs drag [Forces]
  - Engine provides thrust
  - Drag works opposite
- Parasite drag
  - Difference shapes hit more or less wind
- Induced drag
  - Low vs high pressure on the wing
  - Theses pressures meet on the wing tip
  - This causes a vortex
  - This vortex creates a slight downward on the air just ahead of the wing
  - Tilting of the lift vector
  - Wingtip vortices
- Ground effect
  - More lift, less drag because vortex is disrupted
  - "Cushion of air"
- Parasite drag vs induced drag
- Best L/D, power required above and below

### Wing Design [Commercial]

- Aspect ratio: Ratio of wing span to wing chord
  - Low aspect ratio: Concord, fighter jet
  - High aspect ratio: Glider
- Wing taper: more lift and less drag
- Wing loading: how much force each square foot of the wing needs to produce
