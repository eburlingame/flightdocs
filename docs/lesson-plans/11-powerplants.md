# Powerplants and Propellers

## Objective

To understand the basics of a reciprocating engine and a propeller and how it produces thrust in the airplane.

## Motivation

It is important to have an intuitive understanding of how an engine operates to use the engine controls effectively and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

## Elements

### Engines

- Most airplane engines are 4- or 6-cylinder, horizontally-opposed, air-cooled
- 4-stroke engines are most common
- 4 strokes of an engine
  - Intake
  - Compression
  - Combustion
  - Exhaust
- Manifold pressure is the partial vacuum of the airplane "sucking in" air
- Ignition is provided electrical, either from the electrical system or magnetos
  - Magneto are spinning magnets driven by the crank shaft of the engine which produce voltage anytime the engine is on
  - Two sets of spark plugs in each cylinder, one from each magneto
  - Magnetos can be selected independently, and will be checked before flight
- Carburetors
  - Mechanical control of the fuel-air mixture
  - Venturi is a narrowing that accelerates the air, forcing fuel to flow out of the discharge nozzle
  - Mixture needle control mixture
  - Throttle valve controls flow of entire fuel/air mixture into the cylinders
  - Float-type carburetor: Float regulates the fuel entering the float chamber
  - Carburetor icing occurs due to the decrease in air pressure in the venturi
    - This further decreases the air temperature
    - Most likely to occur &lt; 70&deg; F and &gt; 80% humidity
- Fuel-injection
  - Uses a electronically/computer controlled unit to regulate fuel to air mixture
- Oil
  - Wet-sump systems hold oil within the engine itself
    - An oil pump is used to circulate oil to the primary component
  - Dry-sump systems hold oil in a separate tank
- Engine cooling
  - Air-cooling through baffles
  - Oil cooler at the front of the airplane
- Fuel system
  - High-wing airplanes are usually gravity-fed
  - Often airplanes will have an electrical pump and an engine-driven pump
  - Fuel primer is used to draw fuel into the cylinders prior to starting
  - Fuel tanks
    - Wet wings vs wing tanks
  - Fuel selector valves
    - High-wing airplanes may have a "both" option
    - Low-wing airplanes usually do not, and they must be switched
  - Running a fuel tank dry may cause vapor lock and impurities to enter the engine
  - Fuel sumps and drains are usually present
    - At the lowest point on each tank
    - At the lowest point in the system
  - AVGAS grades
- Turbochargers

### Propellers

- Rotating airfoils
  - Subject to angle of attack, stalls
  - The propeller area near the hub is spinning slower than the tip
    - Because of this, propellers are "twisted" so the angle of attack varies to produce more consistent force across the propeller
- Fixed-pitch propellers
  - Primary indication of power in the cockpit is RPM
  - Propellers are calibrated for a single speed
  - A climb prop has lower pitch, less drag: More RPM, horsepower, which increases takeoff and climb performance
  - A cruise prop has a higher pitch, more drag: Less RPM, but increases efficiency
  - Corollary to gears on a bike: Climb prop is a low gear, cruise prop is a high gear
- Some airplanes have "adjustable" pitch propellers, which can be adjusted on the ground

### Constant-Speed Propellers

- Constant-speed propellers vary the pitch of the propeller to maintain an given RPM
- Effect of pitch on RPM
  - A "finer" or large pitch of a propeller increases RPM
  - A "coarser" or smaller pitch of the propeller decreases RPM
- The propeller governor controls the pitch of the propeller to maintain a pilot-selected RPM
- Operation
  - Engine oil is boosted into the propeller hub assembly
  - A spring is tensioned to hold the prop in the full fine or large pitch setting
  - Engine oil must work against this to coarsen the blade
    - The engine oil forces a piston which changes the angle of the blade
  - The amount of oil is governed by a set of fly-weights that are tuned to a specified RPM
    - If the prop spins faster, the flyweights move outward and more oil is forced into the blade angle piston
    - If the prop spins slower, the flyweights fall inward and less oil is allowed to enter the blade angle piston
- When increasing power: Increase prop first, then engine power
- When decreasing power: Decrease power first, then decrease power
- Loss of oil pressure
  - Propeller should fail in the high pitch position
  - This may result in an overspeed condition if power is set too high
