### Airport Surface Hot Spots

- Areas that may cause confusion or have a higher potential for runway incursions
  - Typically involve complex or confusing taxiway geometry
  - Heightened pilot vigilance required when approaching or taxiing through these areas
- Marked on the airport diagram
- Read the hotspot information in the Chart Supplement

### IFR Take-Off Minimums

- Required for commercial operators under 14 CFR Parts 121, 125, 129, or 135
- Standard minimums:
  - **1 s.m. visibility** for 1-2 engines
  - **1/2 s.m. visibility** for more than 2 engines
  - Note: Part 91 operators not legally required to meet these, but compliance strongly encouraged
- Non-standard minimums indicated by the "Triangle T" symbol in the notes section of an approach chart
- May include ceiling requirements if necessary to see and avoid obstacles
- Reduced visibility takeoff may be authorized via specific Operations Specifications (OpSpecs)

### Declared Distance Information

![alt text](images/image-41.png)

- Represent maximum distances suitable for takeoff and landing performance
  - **TORA**: Takeoff Run Available, runway length for ground run
  - **TODA**: Takeoff Distance Available, TORA + clearway length
  - **ASDA**: Accelerate-Stop Distance Available, runway + stopway length for aborted takeoff
  - **LDA**: Landing Distance Available, runway length for ground run of landing aircraft
- Indicated on charts with a specific symbol referencing the Chart Supplement

### Published Departure Procedures

- Preplanned IFR procedures providing obstruction clearance from terminal to en route structure
- Three different types of published departure procedures:
  - **Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)**: printed textually or graphically; primarily for obstacle avoidance
    - Textual ODPs are found in the "takeoff minimums" section
    - Graphical ODPs are published like SIDs, with "(Obstacle)" in the title
  - **Standard Instrument Departures (SID)**: always graphic; designed for ATC flow, capacity, and workload reduction
  - **Diverse vector area (DVA)**: an area in which ATC may provide radar vectors for a climb above the MVA/MIA, in lieu of a ODP or SID
- ODPs do _not_ require a clearance to fly
  - You should always fly an ODP unless the weather is day VFR
- Must possess at least _textual_ description to accept a DP clearance
- Departure procedures are defined around a 40:1 obstacle slope
  - Assumes crossing DER at 35 feet, climbing to 400 feet above DER before turns, and 200 FT/NM climb
  - ODPs/SIDs are only defined at airports with an instrument approach procedure, and which have obstacles which penetrate the 40:1 slope
  - Obstacles that are < 200' are defined as "low close-in obstacles"

### Climb via SID Clearance

- A clearance for a SID which contains published altitude restrictions, which are mandatory
  - Cancels previously issued speed or altitude restrictions when issued
- "Climb via SID except maintain" cancels published altitudes above the cleared level
- ATC ensures obstacle clearance until the aircraft is established on the published SID path
- Examples:
  - "Cleared Loop Six departure." - Fly lateral portion of SID only
  - "Cleared Loop Six departure, climb and maintain four thousand." - Fly lateral portion of SID and speed restrictions, climb to and hold 4000
  - "Climb via SID except maintain flight level one eight zero." - Fly lateral + vertical portion of SID, stop at 18,000
- On initial contact with ATC, inform them of your position when climbing "via":
  - "Cactus Seven Eleven leaving two thousand for one-six thousand, climbing via the Laura Two departure."

### ATC Communication and Compliance with Departure Instructions

- Read back all altitudes, restrictions, and vectors in sequence
- Last clearance received supersedes all previous clearances
- Initial contact after takeoff includes call sign and current altitude leaving
  - "N12382 is 2000 climbing 8000"
- Pilots responsible for requesting amended clearance if a clearance deviates from regulations or safety
- State "NO SIDs" in remarks section of your flightplan if you are unable or unwilling to use them

### Situational Awareness during Departure

- Verify transponder and ADS-B are ON and squawking assigned code
- Monitor instruments to ensure continuous orientation to assigned route, especially when being vectored
- Note initial departure heading for lost communication backup
- Review all pertinent NOTAMs and TFRs before departure

### Climb & Descent Tables

- When departure procedures are designed they look at obstacles within
  - **25 NM** in non-mountainous areas, or
  - **46 NM** in mountainous areas
- Standard procedures assume you can climb at least:
  - **200 ft. / nm**
  - Climb at least **400'** above the runway before turning
- Climb and descent table
  - Located in the front matter of the Terminal Procedures Publication
  - Converts required climb gradient (FT/NM) into a rate of climb (FPM) based on groundspeed
  - Essential for verifying aircraft can meet non-standard climb requirements on ODPs or SIDs
  - Can also be used for rate-of-descent to aid in a stabilized descent on final approach

### IFR Alternate Minimums

[91.175](/_references/14-CFR/91.175)

- Alternates are required if, within &plusmn;**1 hour of your ETA**, the weather is forecast with:
  - Ceilings **&lt; 2000'**, or
  - Visibility is &lt; **3 s.m.**, or
  - The destination does not have an instrument approach.
- If an alternate is required, they must be selected based on the following criteria:
  - For an airports with a **precision** approach, the weather must be better than:
    - **> 600' ceiling**, and
    - **> 2 s.m. visibility**
  - For an airports with a **non-precision** approach, the weather must be better than:
    - **> 800' ceiling**, and
    - **> 2 s.m. visibility**
  - If an airport contains a negative A on its approach plates, then it has non-standard alternate minimums.
    - ![Negative A symbol](/img/content/kcvo-vor-a-header.png)
  - In this case refer to the Alternate Minimums chart for the airport in the TPP:
    - In ForeFlight, this is listed under the Arrival section of the procedures
    - ![Alternative minimums](/img/content/kcvo-alternate-mins.png)
  - Jeppesen Charts include this on the Airport Info chart:
    - ![alt text](images/kcvo-alt-mins.png)
  - If an airport does not have an instrument approach, it can be used as an alternate if:
    - A decent to landing can be made from the **MEA** to the airport in [basic VFR conditions](/_references/14-CFR/91.155)
  - If the chart contains a negative "A" followed by "NA", then that airport cannot be used as an alternate.
    - This may be because the airport does not have weather reporting
- Commercial operators (Part 121/135) have more stringent, OpSpec-driven alternate requirements

### Descent Planning

- Top-of-Descent (TOD) identifies where to begin descent from cruise
- Maintain "Sterile Cockpit" during critical phases of flight, including descent
- Heuristics for descent planning: At 500 fpm: 1000' decent takes 2 minutes
  - At **60** knots ground speed, we're going **1nm** per minute. So **2nm per 1000'**
  - At **90** knots ground speed, we're going **1.5nm** per minute. So **3nm per 1000'**
  - At **120** knots ground speed, we're going **2nm** per minute. So **4nm per 1000'**
- You can also use **ETE** data field on a GPS to determine when to start a descent

### Standard Terminal Arrival Procedures

- Transition aircraft from en route structure to the terminal environment
  - Serve multiple runways and sometimes multiple airports in a terminal area
  - Simplify clearance delivery and reduce radio frequency congestion
- The descent gradient is designed to be **250-350 ft/nm** into the airport
  - At 120 knots GS, this is 500-700 fpm
- Usually terminate at a fix where radar vectors begin or connect to an IAP
- Must have at least textual description in possession to accept STAR clearance
- Put "NO STARs" in your flight plan if you are unable to fly one

### Descend Via STAR Clearance

- Just like SIDs, ATC can issue a "descend via STAR" clearance
  - Authorizes descent at pilot's discretion to meet published altitude and speed restrictions
- Requires aircraft to follow both lateral path and vertical constraints as charted
- "Descend via... except maintain" cancels published altitudes below the cleared level
- VNAV systems may be able to automate the path computation to achieve an efficient descent
