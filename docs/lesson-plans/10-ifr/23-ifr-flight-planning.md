- Revised annually and available in folded or wall-mount versions
- **PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Image of the U.S. IFR/VFR Low Altitude Planning Chart**

## En Route Low Altitude IFR Chart

- Provides aeronautical info for **IFR** navigation below **18,000** feet **MSL**
- Depicts Victor airways (**VOR**-based) and **T-routes** (**RNAV**-based)
- Shows limits of controlled airspace, **VHF** **NAVAIDs**, and reporting points
- Includes minimum en route altitudes (**MEA**) and obstruction clearance altitudes (**MOCA**)
- Contains **OROCA** for situational awareness and emergency use
- Charts are revised every **56** days
- **PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Excerpt of an En Route Low Altitude Chart showing airways and NAVAIDs**

## En Route Chart Symbology

- **NAVAID** boxes show name, identifier, frequency, and Morse code
- Compulsory reporting points depicted as solid triangles
- "On request" reporting points depicted as open triangles
- **MEA** is the lowest altitude between fixes ensuring signal reception and obstacle clearance
- **MOCA** (preceded by \*) ensures signal coverage only within **22** **NM** of a **VOR**
- **MRA** (preceded by symbol) is the lowest altitude to receive an off-course **NAVAID** to identify a fix
- **MCA** (preceded by symbol) is the altitude required to cross a fix when climbing to a higher **MEA**
- **PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Chart excerpt illustrating MEA, MOCA, MRA, and MCA symbols**

## Air Traffic Service (ATS) Route System

- Generic term including **VOR** Federal airways, colored airways, jet routes, and **RNAV** routes
- Victor airways are identified by "**V**" and exist from **1,200**' **AGL** up to **18,000**' **MSL**
- Jet routes are identified by "**J**" and exist from **18,000**' **MSL** to **FL** **450**
- **RNAV** routes include **Q-routes** (high) and **T-routes** (low) depicted in aeronautical blue
- Standard airway width is **8** **NM** (**4** **NM** each side of centerline)
- Routes are contained within Class **E** (low) or Class **A** (high) airspace

## Intersections and Changeover Points

- Intersections are fixes formed by crossing **VOR** radials, **DME**, or **RNAV** waypoints
- Changeover Points (**COP**) specify where to switch navigation guidance from one facility to the next
- **COP** prevents frequency interference and ensures continuous signal reception
- Depicted as a "bent" line symbol on airways with a number indicating mileage from a fix
- If no **COP** is charted, the change should occur at the midpoint of the route segment
- **PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Chart example of a COP symbol and an intersection**

## ATS Route Course Changes

- Pilots required to adhere to airway/route centerlines
- Course changes require lead turns based on turn radius, wind, and airspeed
- Lead points ensure the aircraft remains within protected airspace boundaries
- Distance measuring equipment (**DME**) or **RNAV** used to determine lead points
- High-speed aircraft require more significant turn anticipation

## Flight Deck Management

- Organize charts, navigation logs, and materials for quick, easy access
- Maintain situational awareness by following the flight on a current paper or electronic chart
- Continuously monitor instruments while time-sharing with outside visual scans
- Systematically cross-check **GPS** position against **VOR** or **DME** data
- Track actual time of arrival (**ATA**) and fuel state at each fix to monitor progress
- Keep interior lights low at night to preserve vision

## Position Reporting Requirements

- Required over each compulsory point (solid triangle) when not in radar contact
- Required over each fix used in the flight plan for direct route flights
- Reports include: Identification, Position, Time, Altitude, **ETA**, and next fix
- Actual altitude/flight level included when operating on a clearance specifying "**VFR-on-top**"
- Discontinue reports over compulsory points when informed of "**radar contact**"
- Resume reporting when advised "**radar contact lost**" or "**radar service terminated**"

## Additional Reporting Requirements

- Report vacating any previously assigned altitude/flight level
- Report altitude changes while operating on a "**VFR-on-top**" clearance
- Report being unable to climb/descend at least **500** feet per minute
- Report any missed approach and request further clearance
- Report cruise true airspeed variations of **5%** or **10** knots (whichever is greater)
- Report time and altitude reaching or leaving an assigned holding fix
- Report any loss of **VOR**, **TACAN**, **ADF**, **ILS**, **GPS**, or communication capability
- Report unforecast weather conditions or info relating to safety of flight

## Loss of Communications Procedures (IMC and VMC)

- If in **VMC** or if **VMC** is encountered, continue under **VFR** and land as soon as practicable
- If in **IMC**, follow route (**AVE F**) in order: **Assigned**, **Vectored**, **Expected**, **Filed**
- If in **IMC**, fly altitude (**MEA**) at the highest of: **Minimum**, **Expected**, **Assigned**
- If radio failure occurs while being radar vectored, proceed direct to the fix specified in vector clearance
- Leave clearance limit at the **EFC** time, or if none, at the **ETA** filed in flight plan
- Squawk **7600** to notify **ATC** of radio failure
