## Elements

### VOR Principles of Operation, Transmitter, Receiver, MON

- The Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Range (VOR)
  - Transmits azimuth information referenced to **magnetic north**
  - Projecting 360 courses, or _radials_, extending outward from the ground station
  - Operate within the **108.0 – 117.95 MHz** frequency band.
- Signals are **subject to line-of-sight**
  - The signal cannot be obstructed from the aircraft to the station
- The airborne equipment consists of the antenna, receiver, and the VOR indicator instrument.
- The VOR **measures and presents information to indicate bearing TO or FROM** the navigation facility.
- **Minimum Operational Network (MON):**
  - The FAA is currently retaining a reduced network of VORs, known as the VOR MON
  - Serves as a backup if the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) becomes unavailable
  - Designed to provide nearly continuous VOR signal coverage at **5,000 feet AGL** across the NAS, outside of the Western U.S. Mountainous Area (WUSMA).
  - MON Airports
    - Will have VORs and be accessible within **100 NM** in the contiguous United States (CONUS)
    - They will have ILS or VOR approaches

### VOR Receiver Accuracy Check

See [AIM 1-1-4](/_references/AIM/1-1-4)

- VOR equipment must be checked prior to its use in IFR flight
  - [91.171](/_references/14-CFR/91.171) VOR equipment check for IFR operations.
  - VOR equipment must be checked within the **preceding 30 days**
- Types of VOR checks
  - **Dual VOR Check**: Compare two onboard VOR receivers against each other (tolerance **$\pm$4°**)
  - **VOR Checkpoint**: Many airports have VOR checkpoint signs (tolerance **$\pm$4°**)
  - **VOR Test Facility (VOT)**:
    - VOT stations are listed in the Chart Supplement
    - The Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) must center when the Omnibearing Selector (OBS) reads **0° with a FROM indication**, or **180° with a TO indication**.
  - **Airborne check**: Use a prominent, identifiable point on the centerline of an airway
- The pilot must record in the aircraft logbook or record:
  - Date
  - Place
  - Bearing error
  - Pilot signature

### VOR Class Designations & Service Volumes

- VOR facilities are classed as Terminal, Low altitude, and High altitude
- Standard Service Volumes (SSVs) are defined by the following radial distances:
  - **Terminal (T):** Up to and including 12,000 feet AGL, out to **25 NM**.
  - **Low (L):** Up to and including 18,000 feet AGL, out to **40 NM**.
  - **High (H):** Ranges from 40 NM (below 14,500 feet) up to **130 NM** (between 18,000 and 45,000 feet AGL).
- New VOR service volumes (VL and VH) extend coverage out to **70 NM** above 5,000 feet AGL to support Performance Based Navigation (PBN) routes.

### VOR Errors and Irregularities

- **Accuracy:** Course alignment is accurate, generally within $\pm$1°.
- **Roughness/Oscillation:** Minor course roughness or needle oscillation may occur, especially in mountainous terrain, but should not cause instrument reports unless fluctuations exceed prescribed tolerances.
- **Propeller/Rotor Modulation:** Certain propeller or rotor speeds can induce errors up to $\pm$6° on the CDI.
- **Cone of Confusion:** Directly above the VOR station, the signal is unreliable, causing the CDI needle and TO/FROM indicator to fluctuate (zone of confusion).

### VOR Tuning and Identifying

- VOR procedure requires pilots to **Tune, Identify, and Monitor (TIM)** the facility.
  - **Tune:** Select the VOR frequency using the aircraft receiver.
  - **Identify:** Confirm the Morse code signal or voice announcement stating the name of the facility followed by "VOR".
  - **Signal Status:** A system malfunction or unreliable signal is indicated by an “OFF” flag or a blank TO/FROM indicator.
- If a VOR is out of service, the coded identification signal is removed.

### VOR Orientation

- VOR indicates aircraft direction **FROM the station**; readings are independent of aircraft heading.
- To determine position (radial): Rotate OBS to center CDI needle and read course under **“FROM”** indicator.
- The radial is the line of magnetic bearing extending outward from the VOR.
- To determine course to station: Rotate OBS to center CDI needle and read course under **“TO”** indicator.
- TO/FROM indicator shows direction relative to selected course.
- Reverse sensing occurs if OBS is set to reciprocal of intended course.

### VOR Intercepting

- Determine difference between the radial aircraft is on and the radial to be intercepted.
- Intercept angle: **Double the difference**.
- Intercept angle should be $\ge 20^{\circ}$ and $\le 90^{\circ}$.
- Maintain the intercept heading until CDI centers.
- Then, turn to the magnetic course (radial heading) and begin tracking.
- To avoid overshooting, lead the turn onto the course centerline.

### VOR Tracking / Wind Correction Techniques

- **Tracking:** Flying a constant heading to maintain the desired course over the ground.
- If CDI deflects, turn **in the direction of the needle deflection** to intercept the course.
- Pilot must establish a **wind correction angle (WCA)** to maintain track.
- **Homing:** Flying whatever heading keeps the needle centered (results in a circuitous path over ground).
- Tracking outbound: Set the desired radial with a FROM indication and maintain track.

### VOR Station Passage

- Indicated when the TO/FROM indicator **reverses**.
- CDI needle **fluctuates rapidly** and deviates sharply (cone of confusion).
- If outbound, timing begins over or **abeam the holding fix**, whichever occurs later.
- For a VOR, outbound timing begins when the **TO/FROM indicator reverses**.
