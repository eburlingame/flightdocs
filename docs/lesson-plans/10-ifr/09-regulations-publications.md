  - [91.103](/_references/14-CFR/91.103): Preflight action
    - **NWKRAFT**: NOTAMs, weather forecasts/reports, known ATC delays, runway lengths, alternates, fuel requirements, takeoff and landing distances
  - [91.109](/_references/14-CFR/91.109): Safety pilots and flight training aircraft
    - Safety pilots must be at least a private pilot, rated in the category/class of airplane
  - [91.151](/_references/14-CFR/91.151): Fuel requirements for VFR flight
    - Fly to the first point of intended landing, then for 30 minutes during the day and 45 minutes at night
  - [91.167](/_references/14-CFR/91.167): Fuel requirements for IFR Flight
    - Destination + alternate + 45 minutes reserve
  - [91.169](/_references/14-CFR/91.169): IFR alternate requirements
    - An alternate does not need to be filed if, within **&pm;1** hour of ETA, the ceiling is forecast to be **&gt;2000'**, and visibility is **&gt;3 s.m.**
    - An alternate airport must have forecast weather at your ETA:
      - Airports with precision approach (ILS): **&gt;600'** ceiling / **2 s.m.** visibility
      - Airports with non-precision approach (VOR/GPS): **&gt;800'** ceiling / **2 s.m.**
      - Airports with no IAP: Basic descent from the MEA can be made in basic VFR conditions
      - Or, the alternate minimums specific in the airport's procedure
  - [91.171](/_references/14-CFR/91.171): VOR check and accuracy
    - VOR check must be completed every 30 days for use in IFR
    - Tolerances are &pm;4&deg; for ground-based and dual-VOR checks
    - Tolerances are &pm;6&deg; for flight-based checks
  - [91.173](/_references/14-CFR/91.173): ATC clearance and flight plan requirement
    - An IFR flight plan and ATC clearance is required to fly in _controlled airspace_ under _instrument flight rules_
  - [91.175](/_references/14-CFR/91.175): Takeoff and landing under IFR
    - Descent from the DA/DH is only allowed if
      1. A landing can be made using normal maneuvers and descent rate
      2. The _flight_ visibility is not less than prescribed
      3. One of the necessary visual references are in sight
  - [91.177](/_references/14-CFR/91.177): Minimum altitudes for IFR
    - The minimum altitude for IFR flight is the MEA or MOCA
    - If no MEA or MOCA is defined, then:
      - &gt; 1000' above the highest obstacle in non-mountainous terrain
      - &gt; 2000' above the highest obstacle in mountainous terrain
    - A climb to a higher MEA should be started at the waypoint
  - [91.179](/_references/14-CFR/91.179): IFR cruising levels
    - In controlled airspace, cruise at the level assigned by ATC
    - In uncontrolled airspace:
      - Maintain odd thousands (3000, 5000') on magnetic courses 0 thru 179
      - Maintain even thousands (4000, 6000') on magnetic courses 180 thru 359
  - [91.181](/_references/14-CFR/91.181): Course to be flown
    - Fly on the centerline of an airway, or direct course between fixes
  - [91.183](/_references/14-CFR/91.183): IFR communications
    - Report to ATC when passing mandatory reporting points, except when in radar contact
    - Report to ATC any unforseen weather, or information related to flight safety
  - [91.185](/_references/14-CFR/91.185): Two-way radio communications failure
    - Under VFR: Continue and land in VFR conditions
    - Under IFR:
      - Route: **AVE F**, the last assigned, vectored, expected, or filed route
      - Altitude: **MEA**: fly the highest of minimum altitude for IFR (MEA, MOCA), expected, or assigned altitude
    - If clearance limit is a fix from which an approach begins, leave the clearance limit as close to the expect further clearance time
    - If clearance limit is not a fix from which an approach begins, proceed to a fix where an approach begins and start an approach as close as possible to the filed ETA
  - [91.187](/_references/14-CFR/91.187): Equipment malfunctions under IFR
    - Report to ATC any malfunctions
  - [91.205](/_references/14-CFR/91.205): Requirement instruments and equipment
    - IFR flight requires all VFR-day equipment, plus IFR-required equipment (**GRABCARD**)
  - [91.411](/_references/14-CFR/91.411): Static pressure system inspection
    - IFR static pressure system check must be completed every **24 calendar months**
