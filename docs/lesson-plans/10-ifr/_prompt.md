Create a lesson plan in the following format. The lesson should be in markdown format, with each of these sections as 2nd-level headings:

- **Objective**: What is expected to be learned/understood in this lesson
- **Overview**: Bulleted list of subject titles which will be covered
- **Elements**:
  - Elaborate on each of the overview points.
  - Each overview section should be a 3rd-level heading in the document.
  - Use bullet points underneath to provide details about each point.
  - If a photo would be helpful in the explanation, put `PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: <description of the photo>` in the document.
  - Make bullets very short, not complete sentences but terse, information-dense phrases. Do not include a period at the end of each bullet point.
- **References**: A list of document names and relevant page numbers

This lesson should cover aviation weather reports and forecasts. Bold very important numbers and acronyms, as appropriate. Do not bold terms in the subheadings of each section.

- Graphical Forecasts for Aviation
- Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts
- METARs
- Winds / Temperatures Aloft
- Pilot Reports
- Radar Observations
- Surface Analysis Chart
- Freezing Level Chart
- Upper Level Charts
- Significant Weather Prognostic Charts
- SIGMETs, AIRMETs, & Convective
- SIGMETs
- Recognition of Critical Weather Situations
- Windshear Avoidance

Your primary sources should be the relevant flying handbooks and the aviation weather handbook, also the TERPs manual where appropriate.
