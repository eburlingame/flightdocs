Create a lesson plan in the following format. The lesson should be in markdown format, with each of these sections as 2nd-level headings:

- **Objective**: What is expected to be learned/understood in this lesson
- **Overview**: Bulleted list of subject titles which will be covered
- **Elements**:
  - Elaborate on each of the overview points.
  - Each overview section should be a 3rd-level heading in the document.
  - Use bullet points underneath to provide details about each point.
  - If a photo would be helpful in the explanation, put `PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: <description of the photo>` in the document.
  - Make bullets very short, not complete sentences but terse, information-dense phrases. Do not include a period at the end of each bullet point.
- **References**: A list of document names and relevant page numbers

This lesson should cover IFR cross-country flight planning. Bold very important numbers and acronyms, as appropriate. Do not bold terms in the subheadings of each section.

- Filing an IFR Flight Plan
- Copying / Understanding IFR Clearances
- Dealing with En Route Weather
- Preparation of an IFR Navigation Log
- Planning Departures and Arrivals
- Power / Fuel Management

Your primary sources should be the relevant flying handbooks and the aviation weather handbook, also the TERPs manual where appropriate.
