- **Objective**: What is expected to be learned/understood in this lesson
- **Overview**: Bulleted list of subject titles which will be covered
- **Elements**:
  - Elaborate on each of the overview points.
  - Each overview section should be a 3rd-level heading in the document.
  - Use bullet points underneath to provide details about each point.
  - If a photo would be helpful in the explanation, put `PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: <description of the photo>` in the document.
  - Make bullets very short, not complete sentences but terse, information-dense phrases. Do not include a period at the end of each bullet point.
- **References**: A list of document names and relevant page numbers
