## Elements

### Non-precision Instrument Approaches

- Non-precision approaches are characterized by step-down fixes and a minimum descent altitude.
- Types of non-precision approaches
  - VOR - VOR approach
  - TACAN - TACAN approach
  - LOC - Localizer approach
  - LDA - Localizer directional aid
  - LOC BC - Localizer back course approach
  - ASR - Approach surveillance radar
- Step-down fixes allow descent to lower altitudes after clearing specific obstacles
- Stabilized descent encouraged using Vertical Descent Angle (VDA) data

### Approach Briefing

**W-WIRE**: Weather, waypoints, instruments, radios, everything else

- Complete briefing early while workload is low, use autopilot in single-pilot operations
- Includes validation of local altimeter setting and NOTAMs
- Verification that the aircraft is properly equipped and capable for the procedure

### Missed Approach Procedures

- Non-Precision missed approach point (MAP) can be indicated in different ways
  - **Time from the FAF to MAP** (determine time based on ground speed and distance)
  - **Specific fix** – Identified by DME, VOR cross radial, RNAV (GPS) waypoint, etc.
- Report "missed approach" to ATC immediately and request further clearance
- Memorize first 2-3 steps of procedure to reduce confusion

### Visibility Minimums

Approach landing limitations: [FAR 91.175](/_references/14-CFR/91.175)

- An aircraft may not descend from the DA/MDA unless:
  - Aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing can be made on the intended runway
  - The descent can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers
  - For 121/135 ops: A descent that allows for touchdown in the touchdown zone
  - The _flight_ visibility must be greater than prescribed on the chart
  - At least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is visible:
    - Approach lighting system: The red terminating bars of the ALS allow you to descend to 100' above TDZ, regardless of the approach you're flying
    - Threshold, threshold markings, threshold lights
    - Runway end identifier lights (REILs)
    - Visual glideslope indicator (PAPI/VASI)
    - Touchdown zone, markings, or lights
    - Runway or runway markings
    - Runway lights

Note: only the pilot can determine if the flight visibility meets the landing requirements.

- To summarize:
  - Normal descent + landing can be made
  - Visibility sufficient
  - Runway environment in sight

### Timed Approaches

- Requires an operating control tower and direct communications
- Used to sequence multiple aircraft to the final approach course from a holding fix
- Pilot must adjust flight path within the hold to leave the fix at the exact assigned time

### Radar Approaches

- Controller provides navigational guidance based on radar
  - **Precision Approach Radar (PAR)** provides highly accurate azimuth and elevation guidance
  - **Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR)** provides azimuth only; pilot advised of descent altitudes
- Ideal for "No-Gyro" approaches if heading indicators fail

### Visual Approaches

- Authorization for aircraft on IFR plan to proceed visually and clear of clouds
- Reported weather must be at least 1,000-foot ceiling and 3 SM visibility
- Pilot must have the airport or preceding aircraft in sight
- Pilot assumes responsibility for obstacle clearance and wake turbulence separation
- Not an IAP; has no missed approach segment

### Visual and Contact Approaches

- Visual approaches
  - If the airports has VFR weather, controllers can assign a visual approach
  - We're still IFR, so VFR cloud clearance (91.255) don't apply
  - We need visual separation from other aircraft
  - There is not set procedure here; at a controlled airport they will give you additional instructions if needed
- Charted visual procedures (ex. KPIE North Bay Visual)
  - Often used for noise-abatement
- Contact approaches
  - Gives us permission to descend to and land
  - Need ground-visibility >1 s.m.
  - Pilot needs to ask for a contact approach

### Visual Descent Point

![alt text](images/kcvo-vdp.png)

- Used on non-precision approach charts
- Tells you the last point where a descent to the runway can be made at the established (often, but not always, aligning with the angle of the PAPI/VASI)
- For 3° slope: (Minimum descent height) / 300 = Distance in nm to VDP
- Example: KCVO VOR 17
  - VASI 3° angle: (632 MDH) / 300 = 2.1nm
  - Approach angle 3.2°: (632 / 354) = 1.8
- Depending on our aircraft, we should treat the VDP as the MAP
  - A 172 may be able to make a safe approach and landing at >3° descent angle
  - A Cirrus or a King Air should probably make a missed approach
  - Reminder that we need to land using normal maneuvers

### Circling Approaches

- Maneuver to align with a runway when straight-in alignment exceeds 30°
- Provides 300 feet of obstacle clearance within the protected area
- Radii for protected areas vary by aircraft category and MDA
- Pilot must keep the airport in sight; if lost, initiate missed approach for the procedure flown

### Vectored Approaches

- ATC gives altitudes and headings to establish you on an intercept to the final approach course (usually a few miles behind the FAF)
- Intercept angles typically 30° or less
- Maintain last assigned altitude until established on a published segment of the approach
- Procedure turns are prohibited when receiving radar vectors

### Procedure Turns

- Procedure turn: Published turn area which
  - Usually says "Remain within 10NM" on profile view
  - Types of turns: 45/180, 80/260, teardrop, racetrack
- Hold-in-Lieu of Procedure Turn is a published hold used for course correcting
  - Fly standard hold entry and begin the approach
- When should you _not_ fly a PT/HILPT? - SNoRT
  - S:"Straight-in approach" from ATC
  - No: NoPT on approach chart
  - R: Radar vectored
  - T: Timed approach from a fix

### Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) Approaches

![alt text](images/image-48.png)

- Transition from en route to terminal environment for RNAV-equipped aircraft
  - Think of it like a "mini STAR"
  - Based on a "Basic T" design: two IAFs, one IF/IAF, one FAF, and one MAP
  - Contains Straight-in, Left Base, and Right Base areas with specific minimum altitudes
- Provides minimum altitudes with standard obstacle clearance when operating within the TAA boundaries
- TAA altitudes replace Minimum Safe Altitudes (MSA)
- Once cleared for the approach, pilots may descend in the TAA sector to the minimum altitude depicted within the defined area/subdivision, unless instructed otherwise by air traffic control
  - If you haven't been cleared for the approach, you _cannot_ descent to the TAA sector altitude

### Lighting Systems

- Approach Light Systems (ALS) facilitate the transition from instrument to visual flight
- Includes configurations like ALSF-1, ALSF-2, MALSR, and ODALS
- Visual Glide Slope Indicators (VASI/PAPI) provide vertical guidance to touchdown
  - The VASI/PAPI angle will be shown on the approach chart
- Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are flashing white lights on the runway ends
- Pilot-Controlled Lighting (PCL) allows airborne activation of systems at non-towered airports
