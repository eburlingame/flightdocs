# Autopilot Use in IFR

## Objective

Understand and apply the different autopilot modes, how the autopilot operates, and how it's effective use in an IFR environment.

## Timing

30 minutes

## Format

- [Slides](/slides/autopilot-use.pdf)

## Overview

- Effective use of the autopilot
- Autopilot Documents
- Mode Annunciations
- Lateral Modes
- Vertical Modes
- Approach Modes
- Specific scenarios
  - How to use VNAV Mode
  - Fully-Coupled Go-Around

## Elements

### Effective Use of the Autopilot

- Workload reduction.
- Allows you to focus your attention elsewhere (ATC, briefing and approach, programming avionics, dealing with passengers).
- Spatial disorientation mitigation via LVL button.

### Autopilot Documents

- Retrofit autopilots are installed per an STC.
- GFC 500 Pilot's Guide.
- GFC 500 AFMS (must be in the plane).

### Mode Annunciations

- Green indicates an active mode.
- White indicates an armed mode.

### Initial Mode Activation

- Illustrations of initial mode activation cues.

### Lateral Modes

- Refer to AFM

### Vertical Modes

- Refer to AFM

### Approach Modes

- APR follows glideslope and localizer, capturing glideslope only from below.
- NAV mode can be used for approaches without vertical guidance.

### How to Use VNAV Mode

- Ensure altitudes are configured on the GTN.
- Ensure CDI is in GPS mode.
- Set altitude preselect to the clearance limit.
- Press VNAV to arm (white VNAV annunciation).
- Expect the "Vertical Track" alert one minute before top of descent.
- Intermediate level-offs present with ALTV annunciation.
- VNAV will not capture a descending profile unless the selected altitude is valid and at least 75 feet below current altitude.

### Fully-Coupled Go-Around

- Set missed approach altitude in the preselect.
- At the go-around point, press the GA switch twice to engage G/A (7&deg; pitch-up, wings level).
- Transition to IAS or VS to meet missed approach altitudes.
- Transition to NAV or HDG to track the missed procedure.

## Summary

- Use the autopilot to shed workload in a busy cockpit.
- Guard against mode confusion, especially PIT and ROL modes.
- VNAV requires the altitude bug set below current altitude at the final target altitude.
- Glideslopes only capture from below.
- G/A mode commands 7&deg; nose-up with ALT mode armed.
