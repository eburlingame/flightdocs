## Elements

### Instrument Scan

- Maintaining an instrument scan is fundamental to instrument flying
  - We want to view and interpret each instrument in rapid succession to get a clear sense of our attitude, performance, and navigation
- How fast: Recommended to change instruments fast than 1 per second
- Styles of instrument scan
  - Selected Radial Cross-Check

  - Inverted V Cross-Check

  - Rectangular Cross-Check

- Cross-check errors
  - **Fixation:** Staring at a single instrument (e.g., focusing only on the heading indicator during a turn).
  - **Omission:** Failing to include an instrument that provides critical information for the maneuver (e.g., omitting the heading indicator when recovering from a turn).
  - **Emphasis:** Placing too much reliance or attention on a single instrument instead of the combination necessary for attitude information.
- Instrument interpretation
  - Understanding each instrument's operating principles and **applying this knowledge to the performance of the aircraft** being flown
  - Recognizing what performance to expect and the combination of instruments needed to maintain or correct aircraft control
  - For example: What does a maximum performance climb look like with all your instruments?

### Control and Performance

- Control and performance is all about setting the aircraft into a known configuration, then confirming you're getting the performance that you expect
- Steps
  1. **Establish** a know pitch and power setting
  2. **Trim** to relieve control pressure
  3. **Cross**-check performance instruments
  4. **Adjust** pitch/power as necessary
     - Restrict the Attitude Indicator’s displacement to ½ - 1 bar width movements up or down
- Control Instruments
  - These instruments provide **immediate indications of attitude and power**. They are used primarily to **establish** the desired pitch and power settings,.
  - Examples: Attitude Indicator and Power Indicators (e.g., manifold pressure, tachometer/RPM)
- Performance Instruments
  - These instruments indicate the aircraft's actual performance resulting from inputs made to the control instruments
  - Examples: Altimeter, Airspeed Indicator (ASI), Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI), Heading Indicator, and Turn Coordinator

### Primary and Secondary

- Instruments are grouped as they relate to control function and aircraft performance as pitch control, bank control, power control, and trim.
- Depending on the maneuver desired, you place different emphasis on different instruments.
- Each instrument provides a direct and/or indirect indication of attitude
  - Attitude indicator: Direct indication of pitch and bank
  - Airspeed indicator
  - Altimeter
  - Turn coordinator
  - Heading indicator
  - Vertical speed indicator
