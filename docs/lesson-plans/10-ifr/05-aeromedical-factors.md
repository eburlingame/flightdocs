## Elements

### Hypoxia

- **Cause**: Hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs
- **Symptoms**: Cyanosis, headache, dizziness, euphoria, impaired vision, drowsiness
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Use supplemental Oxygen
  - Fly lower
  - Address any pollution in the air
- Time of useful consciousness
  - From AC 61-107B
- Types of Hypoxia
  - **Hypoxic**: Caused by the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude
  - **Hypemic**: Caused by the blood not being able to take up and transport a sufficient amount of oxygen; CO poisoning
  - **Stagnant**: Caused by a lack of circulation of oxygenated blood in the body; can occur during high-G maneuvers

### Hyperventilation

- **Cause**: Excessive rate and depth of respiration leading to abnormal loss of carbon dioxide
- **Symptoms**: Rapid breathing, visual impairment, sweaty skin, dizziness
  - Often occurs with stress or anxiety
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Breathe slowly
  - Speak something slowly
  - Breathe into a bag

### Middle ear and sinus problems

- **Cause**: Blockage of the Eustachian tube which equalizes pressure between both sides of your ear drum. Often happens with inflammation
- **Symptoms**:
  - Ear pain and pressure
  - Muffled hearing
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Valsalva method
  - Descend slowly
  - Avoid flying with any sinus blockage
  - Decongestants can be helpful (for passengers)

### Spatial disorientation

- **Cause**: Disagreement or confusion between your sensory systems about the aircraft's position, attitude, or movement
- **Symptoms**:
  - Confusion
  - Loss of airplane control
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Trust flight instruments
  - Limit maneuvering
  - Limit rapid head movements

### Illusions that contribute to spatial disorientation

- The "leans"
  - After a long gradual turn, the airplane is returned to level
  - The plane may feel as though it's banking in the opposite direction
- Graveyard spiral
  - During a prolonged, coordinated, constant-rate turn (especially in IMC), the pilot may not sense the turn due to lack of sensory cues
  - Noticing a loss of altitude, the pilot may mistakenly believe the wings are level and pull back on the controls to stop the descent
  - This action tightens the turn, increasing the rate of descent and tightening the spiral
  - The result is a nose-low, descending, high-G turn that can lead to loss of control if not recognized and corrected
- Coriolis illusion
  - Rapid head movement during a turn
  - The plane may feel as though it's banking in the opposite direction
- Somatogravic illusion
  - Acceleration may feel like a pitching-up movement
  - Especially true with limited visual reference, like at night
  - Pilot may consequently push into a nose-low attitude
  - Likewise, deceleration may cause the sensation of pitching down
- Inversion illusion
  - Abrupt change from climbing to straight-and-level flight can create the illusion of tumbling backwards
  - Pilots may then push the aircraft into a nose-low attitude
- Elevator illusion
  - Upward vertical acceleration like an updraft can create the illusion of being in a climb
  - Pilots may push the aircraft into a nose-low attitude
  - Likewise a downward acceleration can create the illusion of being in a descent

### Overcoming disorienting illusions

- Trust flight instruments
- Instrument training and proficiency
- Limit maneuvering, especially high-load factor maneuvers
- Limit rapid head movements
- Use autopilot if needed

### Motion sickness

- **Cause**: The brain receiving conflicting messages about the state of the body's position in space.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Nausea
  - Dizziness
  - Paleness, sweaty, clammy skin
  - Vomiting
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Fresh air
  - Focus on objects outside the airplane
  - Avoid unnecessary head movements
  - Always have a bag

### Carbon monoxide poisoning

- **Cause**: Hypemic hypoxia caused by the presence of CO in the air, which attaches to hemoglobin in the blood.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Headache
  - Drowsiness
  - Blurred vision
  - Loss of muscle power
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Close heater vent
  - Land and ventilate the cabin
  - Open fresh air vents

### Stress

- **Cause**: The body's response to physical and psychological demands placed upon it. Stress can be chronic or acute.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Agitation
  - Not thinking well
  - Fatigue
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Correct underlying stressors, which may require medical treatment for chronic stress

### Fatigue

- **Cause**: Acute fatigue is caused by lack of sleep. Chronic fatigue usually has medical underpinnings.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Drowsiness
  - Errors in judgment, timing, computation
  - Loss of muscle control
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Chronic fatigue: correct underlying issues, which may require medical attention
  - Acute fatigue: Rest

### Dehydration

- **Cause**: Critical loss of water or electrolytes from the body
- **Symptoms**:
  - Headache
  - Fatigue
  - Drowsiness
  - Cramps
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes
  - Drink before you become thirsty
  - Your thirst response may work too slowly to warn of the onset of dehydration

### Hypothermia

- **Cause**: Exposure to cold temperature for extended periods.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Coldness
  - Shivering
  - Drowsiness
  - Loss of consciousness
- **Corrective Actions**
  - Move to a warmer environment
  - Add clothing, blankets, or coats
  - Cover exposed areas

### Alcohol

- **Symptoms**:
  - Symptoms similar to that of hypoxia
  - Impaired judgement, coordination, reaction time
- Regulations
  - Alcohol, 14 CFR Part [91.17](/_references/14-CFR/91.17):
    - 8 hours single last alcoholic drink before acting a crew member ("bottle to throttle")
    - 0.04% BAC limit
    - Cannot carry drunk passengers, except in an emergency or under the supervision of a doctor

### Drugs

- Regulations: Part [61.53](/_references/14-CFR/61.53):
  - A pilot cannot act as PIC if:
    - They have any known condition that would make them ineligible for a medical
    - Are receiving treatment or taking medication that would make them ineligible for a medical
- [AOPA Drug Database](https://www.aopa.org/go-fly/medical-resources/medications-database)
- FAA [Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug List](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/medications/OTCMedicationsforPilots.pdf)
- Check the half-life of any drug you intend to take
- Substances to Avoid
  - Nicotine: Impaired night vision, CO poisoning
  - Amphetamines: Impaired vision, impaired judgement
  - Caffeine: Impaired judgement, dehydration, headaches
  - Antacids: Release CO2 at altitude
  - Antihistamines: Drowsiness, dizziness
  - Aspirin: Contribute to hypoxia
  - Prescription pain killers
  - Illicit drugs

### Dissolved nitrogen in the bloodstream after SCUBA dives

- **Cause**: Dissolved nitrogen in the blood being forced out of body
- **Corrective Actions**
  - For flights below 8,0000' MSL:
    - At least **12 hours** after diving that does not require controlled ascent (non-decompression stop diving)
    - At least **24 hours** after diving that does require controlled ascent (decompression stop diving)
  - For flights above 8,000' MSL: At least **24 hours**

### IMSAFE checklist

- Preflight self-evaluation:
  1. Illness
  2. Medication
  3. Stress
  4. Alcohol
  5. Fatigue
  6. Emotion

### Hazardous attitudes

- Attitudes
  - **Anti-authority**: "Don't tell me what to do"
  - **Impulsivity**: "I can do it quickly"
  - **Invulnerability**: "It won't happen to me"
  - **Macho**: "I can do it"
  - **Resignation**: "What's the use?"
- Antidotes
  - **Anti-authority**: Follow the rules, they are usually right.
  - **Impulsivity**: Not so fast, think first.
  - **Invulnerability**: It could happen to me.
  - **Macho**: Taking chances is foolish.
  - **Resignation**: I am not helpless, I can make a difference.
  - **Stress**: I can manage stress.
- Learn to recognize these attitudes when they occur. Slow down and state the antidote to yourself

### Get-There-itis

- The desire to get to a destination, complete the mission, or meet a schedule
- Pilots can feel pressured to continue, even when conditions are unsafe
- Consequences of not getting there are _immediate_ and _specific_
- Consequences of an accident are _vague_ and _hypothetical_

### Combatting Get-There-itis

- Recognize the symptoms
- Avoid situations where you feel pressured to continue
- Avoid situations where peer pressure would be strong

- Runway Width Illusion
- Sloping Runway Illusion
- Other Illusions
  - Featureless terrain
    - Over water at night
    - Aircraft may appear higher than it actually is
    - "Black hole" approaches
  - Water on windscreen
    - The aircraft seems higher than it actually is
  - Haze
    - Aircraft may appear to be further away
  - Fog
