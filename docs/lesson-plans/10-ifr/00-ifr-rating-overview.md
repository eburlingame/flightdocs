# Instrument Rating Overview

## Training

The instrument rating is an additional _rating_ on your existing pilot certificate. The requirements for getting an instrument rating are listed in [61.65](/_references/14-CFR/61.65):

- Hold, or be concurrently applying for, a private pilot certificate
- Speak, read, and write the English language
- Receive and log ground training from an instructor or accomplish a home-study course
- Receive a logbook endorsement from an instructor certifying that the student is prepared to take the knowledge test
- Pass the required knowledge test on the following aeronautical knowledge areas:
  - Federal Aviation Regulations apply to flight operations under IFR
  - Flight operations under IFR as described in the AIM
  - ATC system and procedures for instrument flight operations
  - IFR navigation and approaches
  - Use of IFR en route and instrument approach procedure charts
  - Procurement and use of aviation weather reports and forecasts, the elements of forecasting weather trends based on that information, personal observation of weather conditions
  - Safe and efficient operation of aircraft under instrument flight rules and conditions
  - Recognition of critical weather situations and windshear avoidance
  - Aeronautical decision making and judgment
  - Crew resource management, including crew communication and coordination
- Receive and log training on these areas:
  - Preflight procedures
  - Air traffic control clearances and procedures
  - Flight by reference to instruments
  - Navigation systems
  - Instrument approach procedures
  - Emergency operations
  - Postflight procedures
- Receive a logbook or training record endorsement from an authorized instructor certifying that the person is prepared to take the required practical test
- Pass a practical test on the area of operations listed above
  - Practical test is structured around the [Instrument Rating ACS for Airplanes](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/instrument_rating_airplane_acs_8.pdf)

## Aeronautical Experience

- **50 hours** of total cross-country time, of which **10** must be in airplanes
  - XC time is [defined as](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.1#p-61.1(b)(Cross-country%20time)>) time in an airplane that includes a landing at another airport and involves navigation or pilotage.
  - For an IFR rating, the flight must include a point of landing at least **50 nm** straight-line distance from the original point of departure
- **40 hours** of actual or simulated instrument time
  - Must include **15 hours** with an authorized CFI-I
  - **3 hours** of flight training within **2** calendar months of the test
  - One XC flight under IFR, filed with an ATC facility:
    - At least **250 nm** along airways or ATC routing
    - 3 different kinds of instrument approaches
    - An approach at each airport

## Logbook Entries

Logging Instrument Flight Time [61.51(g)](</_references/14-CFR/61.51(g)>):

- A person may log instrument time only for that flight time when the person operates the aircraft solely by reference to instruments under actual or simulated instrument flight conditions.
- An authorized instructor may log instrument time when conducting instrument flight instruction in actual instrument flight conditions
- Logging instrument time to meet the recent instrument experience:
  - The location and type of each instrument approach accomplished; and
  - The name of the safety pilot, if required.
- A full flight simulator (FFS), flight training device (FTD), or aviation training device (ATD) for acquiring instrument aeronautical experience for a pilot certificate or rating provided an authorized instructor is present.

A logbook entry needs to include ([61.51(b)](</_references/14-CFR/61.51(b)>))

- Day or night time
- Actual or simulated instrument time

## IFR Recent Experience

[61.51(c)](</_references/14-CFR/61.51(c)>)

To file and fly under IFR, you must have, within the **6 calendar months**, performed and logged at least the following tasks and iterations in actual IFR weather conditions, or simulated IFR weather conditions using a view-limiting device:

- Six instrument approaches\*
- Holding procedures and tasks
- Intercepting and tracking courses through the use of navigational electronic systems

> Note that the approaches need to be done in simulated instrument conditions to the DA/MAP, or the airplane transition to VMC on the final approach segment ([FAA InFO 15012](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/pilots/training/firc/InFO15012.pdf)).

A pilot may accomplish this requirement in a full flight simulator (FFS), flight training device (FTD), or aviation training device (ATD) provided the device represents the category of aircraft for the instrument rating privileges, and the pilot performs the tasks in simulated instrument conditions.

A person who has failed to meet the above experience requirements for more than **6 calendar months** may reestablish instrument currency only by completing an [instrument proficiency check](/docs/lesson-plans/ifr/ipcs).
