## Elements

### Clearance Delivery

- Responsible for transmitting IFR clearances to departing aircraft
- Usually the first ATC point of contact at towered airports
- Clearances follow the **C-R-A-F-T** format:
  - Clearance limit
  - Route
  - Altitude
  - Frequency
  - Transponder code
- May use automated systems like Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC) or Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC-DCL)
- Pilots should call no more than 10 minutes before the proposed taxi time

### Ground Control

- Responsible for safe movement of aircraft on airport taxiways and non-active runways
- ATC must issue an explicit clearance for every runway crossing
- Pilots required to provide a full readback of all "hold short" instructions
- Usually on 121.\*, like 121.6 and 121.9 MHz
  - Sometimes this will be call "Ground point 6", meaning 121.6

### Tower Control (Local Control)

- Responsible for separation of aircraft operating on active runways and within Class D airspace
- Issues takeoff and landing clearances
- Coordinates with Departure Control for an IFR "release" prior to authorizing takeoff
- Primary surveillance in VFR conditions is a visual scan of the airport and local area
- May use Digital Bright Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) to identify aircraft exact locations

### Terminal Approach Control Facilities

- Commonly known as TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control)
- Provides the link between the departure airport and the en route structure
- Also controls approaches into other airports in the region (not the primary airport)
- Airspace typically extends **30 NM** from the facility up to **10,000 feet MSL**
- Radar system based around the primary airport
  - Uses Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) to track primary and secondary targets
  - Automated Radar Terminal Systems (ARTS) receives transponder signals
- Authorized to assign altitudes below published procedural minimums using Minimum Vectoring Altitudes (MVA)

### Approach Control

- Responsible for controlling instrument flights within a designated terminal area
- Sequences arriving aircraft to the final approach course
- Maintains separation between IFR and participating VFR aircraft in Class B, Class C, or TRSA airspace
- Radar service is automatically terminated once the landing is complete or the pilot changes to advisory frequency

### Departure Control

- Ensures separation between departing aircraft
- Clears aircraft out of the terminal area using radar vectors, DVAs, or published DPs
- Verifies that the aircraft's Mode C altitude matches the pilot's reported altitude on initial contact
- Maintains control until the aircraft is released on course or handed off to an ARTCC

### Final Controller

- A controller providing information and final approach guidance during PAR and ASR approaches
  - In PAR, provides highly accurate azimuth and elevation guidance until the aircraft reaches the DH
  - In ASR, provides azimuth guidance and advises the pilot of the MAP location
- In simultaneous parallel approaches, a "monitor controller" ensures aircraft do not penetrate the No Transgression Zone (NTZ)

### Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC)

![alt text](images/image-53.png)

- Maintains separation between IFR flights in the en route structure
- Each "Center" manages thousands of square miles of airspace divided into high and low sectors
- Radars (Air Route Surveillance Radar) have a wider range but slower update rate than terminal radar
- Provides "Approach Control" services to airports not served by a TRACON
- Uses flight progress strips to assess the traffic situation and avoid conflicts

### Tower En Route Control (TEC)

- An ATC program linking adjacent approach control areas, used to control short flights in congested airspace
- Enables IFR flight entirely within terminal radar airspace without entering the Center environment
- Generally restricted to non-turbojet aircraft operating below 10,000 feet
- Abbreviated filing procedures available by including "TEC" in flight plan remarks
- TEC routes are published in the Chart Supplement

### Federal Airways

![alt text](images/image-54.png)

- Victor airways, jet routes, and T-routes
  - **Victor airways (V-prefix)** are Class E airspace from 1,200 feet AGL up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL
  - **Jet routes (J-prefix)** extend from 18,000 feet MSL to FL 450
  - **T-Routes (T-prefix)**: RNAV airways which do not use VORs
- Standard airway width is 8 NM (4 NM on each side of the centerline)
- Airway segments are divided at Changeover Points (COPs) to ensure continuous signal reception

### Uncontrolled Airspace

- Airspace not designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E is Class G
- ATC does not exercise control or provide separation in Class G
- Pilots must obtain IFR clearances via phone or radio prior to entering controlled airspace
- PIC is responsible for terrain and obstruction clearance when operating on unpublished routes in Class G

### IFR Flight Planning and Filing Procedures

- Flight plans must be filed at least 30 minutes before the proposed departure time
- ICAO format (FAA Form 7233-4) is now the standard for all IFR flight plans
- Requires assessment of weather, fuel (destination + alternate + 45 minutes), and NOTAMs
- Alternate airport must be filed if the "1-2-3" rule applies

### Closing an IFR Flight Plan

- IFR flight plans at _towered airports_ close automatically upon landing
- At non-towered airports, the pilot is responsible for closing the flight plan
  - Cancellation can be done via radio with ATC in the air or on the ground
  - Or by calling a FSS after landing
- Failure to close within 30 minutes of ETA results in the initiation of Search and Rescue (SAR)
- Pilots can cancel IFR while airborne in VMC conditions outside Class A airspace
