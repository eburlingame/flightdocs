### Air Traffic Clearance

- Pilot:
  - Acknowledge receipt and understanding of **ATC** clearance
  - Read back any **hold short** instructions verbatim
  - Request clarification or amendment if clearance is not understood or considered unsafe
  - Comply promptly unless an emergency necessitates deviation
- Controller:
  - Issue appropriate clearances for the specific operation
  - Assign altitudes at or above **Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)**
  - Ensure pilot acknowledgement and correct distorted or incomplete readbacks

[AIM 5-5-2](/_references/AIM/5-5-2), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-3](/_references/IFH/10-3)

### Contact Approach

- Pilot:
  - Must request a contact approach and makes it in lieu of a standard or special instrument approach
  - Indicate aircraft is clear of clouds and has at least **1 s.m.** flight visibility
  - Assume full responsibility for **obstruction clearance**
  - Advise **ATC** immediately if unable to maintain **1 s.m.** visibility or clear of clouds
- Controller:
  - Verify reported ground visibility at destination is at least **1 s.m.**
  - Provide separation from other **IFR** or **Special VFR (SVFR)** traffic

[AIM 5-5-3](/_references/AIM/5-5-3), [Pilot-Controller Glossary](/_references/Pilot-Controller-Glossary/)

### Visual Approach

- Pilot:
  - Must have airport or preceding aircraft in sight at all times
  - Remain clear of clouds and follow the preceding aircraft as instructed
  - Responsible for **wake turbulence** separation and safe landing interval behind preceding traffic
  - Advise **ATC** immediately if sight of airport is lost or clouds cannot be avoided
  - In the event of a go-around, pilot is responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance until reaching an ATC assigned altitude if issued
- Controller:
  - Clearance authorized only if weather is at least **1,000-3**
  - Provide separation unless pilot is applying **visual separation**
  - Inform pilot if the preceding aircraft is a **Heavy** or **B757**

[AIM 5-5-11](/_references/AIM/5-5-11), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-20](/_references/IFH/10-20)

### Instrument Approach

- Pilot:
  - Follow all procedures shown on the approach chart, including restrictive notations
  - Maintain last assigned altitude until established on a segment of a published route
  - Comply with **Minimum Altitude** for **IFR**
- Controller:
  - Issue clearance based on known traffic only
  - Assign appropriate maintenance altitude until established on a published segment

[AIM 5-5-4](/_references/AIM/5-5-4), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-13](/_references/IFH/10-13)

### Missed Approach

- Pilot:
  - Execute immediately if landing requirements not met at **MAP** or **DA/DH**
  - Advise **ATC** and include reason for the miss
  - Fly the lateral navigation path to the **MAP** before turning if executing early
  - Request clearance for specific next action (alternate, re-try, etc.)
  - If a cold-weather adjustment has been applied, notify ATC
- Controller:
  - Issue alternate instructions if published procedure is not desired
  - Vector radar-identified aircraft when operationally advantageous

[AIM 5-5-5](/_references/AIM/5-5-5), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-21](/_references/IFH/10-21)

### Radar Vectors

- Pilot:
  - Promptly comply with assigned headings and altitudes
  - Question any instruction believed to be incorrect
  - Advise ATC if compliance would cause a violation of any FAR
- Controller:
  - Vector in controlled airspace for separation, noise abatement, or operational advantage
  - Vector IFR aircraft at or above **Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA)**
  - Assign altitude (and speed if necessary) when vectoring off a procedure with restrictions

[AIM 5-5-6](/_references/AIM/5-5-6), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 2-11](/_references/IFH/2-11)

### Safety Alerts

- Pilot:
  - Initiate appropriate action immediately upon receipt of an alert
  - Aware that service is not always available due to controller workload or radar limitations
- Controller:
  - Issue alert if aware that aircraft is at an altitude placing it in unsafe proximity to terrain or obstructions (**Terrain/Obstruction Alert**)
  - Issue alert if aware of another aircraft placing both in unsafe proximity (**Aircraft Conflict Alert**)

[AIM 5-5-9](/_references/AIM/5-5-9), [AIM 2-1-6](/_references/AIM/2-1-6)

### Speed Adjustments

- Pilot:
  - Advise **ATC** if **True Airspeed (TAS)** at cruise varies by **10 knots** or **5%** (whichever is greater) from flight plan
  - Comply with adjustments within **±10 knots** or **0.02 Mach**
  - Advise **ATC** immediately if unable to comply
- Controller:
  - Assign speeds when necessary for spacing, but not as a substitute for good vectoring
  - Adhere to **JO 7110.65** restrictions on speed adjustment application

[AIM 5-5-7](/_references/AIM/5-5-7), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-4](/_references/IFH/10-4)

### Visual Separation

- Pilot:

  - Maintain constant visual surveillance until the other aircraft is no longer a factor
  - Notify **ATC** immediately if visual contact is lost
- Controller:
  - Apply in terminal area when both aircraft are in sight or by instructing pilot to maintain it
  - Apply in en route airspace when aircraft are on opposite courses and pilot reports they have passed

  - Specify takeoff direction, turn, or initial heading consistent with **DP** or **Diverse Vector Area (DVA)**
  - Obtain pilot concurrence at non-towered airports before specifying takeoff direction

[AIM 5-5-14](/_references/AIM/5-5-14), [Instrument Flying Handbook pg. 10-5](/_references/IFH/10-5)

### Wake Turbulence Separations

- Pilot:
  - Exercise vigilance and adjust flight path as necessary to avoid vortices
