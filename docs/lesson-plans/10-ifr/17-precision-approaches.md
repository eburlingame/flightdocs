## Elements

Precision approaches are characterized by vertical and horizontal guidance that positions the aircraft close to the runway.

- PAR - Precision approach radar
- GLS - GBAS landing system
- ILS - Instrument landing system
  - Localizer:
    - Positioned at the end of the runway, such that the signal is 700' wide at the threshold
    - Gives precise angular guidance aligned with the runway
    - Note that the exact sensitivity is dependent on the length of the runway
  - Glideslope:
    - Positioned to the side of the runway
    - Gives angular guidance, usually for a 3° glideslope
    - Beware of false glideslopes
  - ILS used to have marker beacons
    - Outer marker: FAF
    - Middle marker: Minimum
    - Inner marker: Lower minimums (CAT II or III)
    - These are increasingly rare, approaches use DME or secondary VOR to identify fixes
  - ILS typically have minimums of 200 feet above TDZE
  - Capturing an ILS course: Most autopilot will only capture from below
