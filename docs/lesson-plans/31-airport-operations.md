# Airport Operations

## Objective

Identify airport operations and procedures, including traffic patterns, runway identifiers, and light gun signals. Understand the role of ATC and the importance of communication with them.

## Motivation

Understanding airport operations is critical for safe flight operations. Pilots need to be familiar with traffic patterns and the role of ATC in managing air traffic. This knowledge will help pilots navigate airports safely and efficiently.

## Elements

- Hazards operating near an airport
  - Traffic congestion
  - Climbing/descending aircraft
  - Pilot preoccupation
- Runway numbers
  - Aligned with magnetic north heading (Heading 140&deg; M given runway 14)
  - Shift slowly over time
  - Parallel runways will be given L, R, or C designations
- What is a traffic pattern?
- Traffic pattern altitude
  - Chart supplement
  - Propeller-driven aircraft: 1000' above field elevation
  - Large or turbine aircraft: 1500' above field elevation
  - Helicopters: 500'
- Traffic pattern direction
  - Shown in chart supplement, sectional ("RP 36"), and ForeFlight
  - If not shown, left traffic is implied
- Traffic pattern legs
  - Upwind leg
  - Crosswind leg
  - Downwind leg
  - Base leg
  - Final approach
  - Departure
- Traffic pattern entry and exit
  - Enter in level flight abeam the midpoint of the runway
  - If remaining in the pattern, start crosswind leg within 300' of pattern altitude
  - When departing the pattern, depart straight-out or 34&deg; in the direction of the pattern
  - When operating with parallel runways, don't overshoot the final turn
- Visual indicators
  - Segmented circle/traffic pattern indicator: Shows traffic pattern direction
  - Tetrahedron: Land in the direction that it's pointed
- Right-of-way [91.113](/_references/14-CFR/91.113)
  - When two airplanes are approaching to land, the lower one has right-of-way
  - However, you cannot take advantage of this by cutting in front of another aircraft
- Airports with a ATCT
  - Maintain contact with the control tower while you're in the airspace
  - Some airports have a radar display, but not all
    - Traffic advisories
    - Recommended headings
- Runway distances
  - TORA: Takeoff runway Available, usually the length of the runway
  - TODA: Takeoff distance available, TODA plus any clearway or stopway beyond the end of the runway
  - ASDA: Accelerate-Stop Distance Available: Distance available to accelerate and stop
  - LDA: Landing distance available: Runway length, minus any displayed threshold
  - These may be less than physical distances to account for runway safety area buffers
- Intersection takeoffs
  - Controller will give you take off distance available from interesection
  - Pilots need to accept or decline
- Wake turbulence holds
  - ATC will hold light aircraft for 3 minutes if a large aircraft has just takeoff
  - "Hold for wake turbulence"
  - Pilots can request to waive this, "Request to waiver 3 minute interval"
- LAHSO: Land and hold short operations
  - Land before an intersecting runway or taxiway
  - PIC needs to accept or decline LASHO requests
  - Land and hold short points are listed in the Chart Supplement, with the Available Landing Distance (ALD) for the runway
  - Example: `N12382 cleared to land runway six right, hold short of taxiway bravo for crossing traffic B737.`
  - Need basic VFR weather conditions
- Light gun signals
- Ground control frequencies ("GROUND POINT 7" means 121.7)
- "Cleared for the option", means cleared for one of:
  - touch-and-go
  - low approach
  - missed approach
  - stop-and-go
  - full stop landing
- Aircraft lights
  - Beacon/anti-collision lights on when aircraft is in motion
  - Position/nav lights are required to be on sunset to sunrise
  - Strobes should be used in flight (not when taxiing), unless reflecting in clouds is hazardous
  - All lights should be used when crossing runways
- Operation Lights On
  - Pilots are encouraged to use landing light, day or night, up to 10,000'
- ASOS/AWOS
  - Should be available &lt; 10,000 ft within 25nm
  - "I have the one-minute weather for Salem"
