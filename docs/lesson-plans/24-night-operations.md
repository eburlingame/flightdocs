# Night Operations

## Objective

To understand the risks and challenges for operating aircraft at night.

## Motivation

Night flying is a privilege of a private pilots, and involves numerous additional risk factors from day flying. We want to know how to identify and mitigate those risk, and fly effectively when its dark.

## Knowledge Checks

- You are flying at night and see a white light and a green light ahead of you. What is the other aircraft's relative position?
- You see a light on the ground that has two white flashes, then a green flash. Can you land at that airport?
- Your engine fails at night. You are flying above and Interstate highway. Would you land on the highway? What are some of your concerns?
- You are on a long cross-country flight at night in eastern Washington. You are flying over a large area of unlit terrain. In the distance you see a group of synchronized flashing red lights. What do you think they are?
