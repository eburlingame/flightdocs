# Teaching Practical Risk Management

## Objective

Understand the responsibility of the instruction to mitigate risks associated with teaching, and teach students to evaluate risk systematically.

## Motivation

Effective risk management is one of the most important skills a pilot needs to learn, understand, and practice as a habit.

## Timing

- 30 minutes

## Format

- Slides

## Elements

- Teaching risk identification, assessment, and mitigation
- Teaching risk management tools, including:
  - Pilot/Aircraft/enVironment/External Pressures (PAVE) checklist
  - Flight Risk Assessment Tools (FRATs)
- When and how to introduce risk management.
- Risk management teaching techniques by phase of instruction.
- Managing risk during flight instruction, including:
  - Common flight instruction risks
  - Best practices
  - Special considerations while teaching takeoffs and landings
- Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM) to include using Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM), as appropriate.
- Hazards associated with providing flight instruction.
- Obstacles to maintaining situational awareness during flight instruction.
- Recognizing and managing hazards arising from human behavior, including hazardous attitudes.
- Use scenario-based training (SBT) to demonstrate, teach, and assess risk management and Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM) skills in the context of a Task specified by the evaluator.
- Identify, assess, and mitigate risks commonly associated with flight instruction by maintaining:
  - Awareness and oversight of the learner’s actions, with timely and appropriate supervision, intervention, or mitigation as needed
  - Awareness of the learner’s cognitive/physiological state, with timely action to mitigate anxiety, fatigue, or other obstruction to learning
  - Overall situational awareness of the aircraft’s dynamic state, its position in space, and vigilance for unexpected events or changing circumstances that occur in the environment
- Model and teach safety practices, including maintaining:
  - Collision avoidance while simultaneously providing instruction
  - Avoidance of unnecessary distractions
  - Coordinated flight
  - Awareness of who is manipulating controls through positive exchange of flight controls
  - Continuous awareness of the aircraft’s dynamic state and position in the NAS
