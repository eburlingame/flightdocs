# Checkride Tips

## Instructor

### Be there for the first 30 minutes

- Be there to resolve any logbook or endorsement issues

### Be there for the de-brief

- Chat with the DPE and ask discuss what they would've liked to see done differently

## Student

### Checkride Preparation

- Don't cram for the test
- Get plenty of sleep and eat a good breakfast
- Be prepared with a packed lunch and snacks are you need
- Create a document with all your endorsements, hours, ARROW and AV1ATED documents to present

### Checkride Requirements

The checkride cannot start unless:

- The student has all the necessary endorsements, medical, and experience for the rating sought
- The aircraft can be shown to be airworthy
- The is a reasonable assurance that the flight portion can be completed

### Outcome of the Checkride

There are three possible outcomes of the checkride:

- Pass and earn the certificate/rating
- Discontinuance
  - Not a failure, a pause in the test to be continued later
  - May happen for a unknown airworthiness issue
  - Weather conditions aren't suitable for flight portion
- Disapproval
  - Examining is required to inform you right away if something doesn't meet the ACS/PTS
  - They will ask you if you'd like to continue with the rest of the areas of operation
  - Deciding to continue is up to you
  - The re-check of a checkride will involve demonstrating anything that was unsatisfactory from the previous checkride, and possible repeated some items at the examiner's discretion

### Emotional Support

The checkride is a final check of all the work you've already done. With proper preparation, the checkride is just a chat and a short flight.
