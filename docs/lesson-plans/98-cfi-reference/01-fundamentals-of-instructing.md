# Fundamentals of Instructing Overview

## Human Behavior

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

- Abraham Maslow studied human needs and motivation
- He discovered than certain needs take precedent over others
- Learners tend to show little to no motivation or attention if most of their needs are not met
  - If a student is hungry, they will focus on that instead of a lesson
  - If a student feels unsafe, they will be distracted by a flight response
- Utilize a pre-lesson evaluation of readiness
  - Do you best to verify whether the learner is physically and mentally ready to learn

1. Physiological
2. Security
3. Belonging
4. Esteem
5. Cognitive and Aesthetic
6. Self-Actualization

### Defense Mechanisms

- **Repression**: A person places uncomfortable thoughts in an inaccessible area of the mind
  - Not wanting to think about a bad lesson or flight
- **Denial**: Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening
  - Refusing to accept that the maneuver was that bad
- **Compensation**: Emphasizing strengths in other areas to distract from or disguise a weakness
  - "My landings were terrible, but my steep turns were great"
- **Projection**: Projecting the blame of a personal failing onto someone else
  - "That instructor is terrible, they don't know what they're doing"
- **Rationalization**: Justifying poor performance on external factors outside of their control
  - "The wind was too strong, that's why I couldn't hold altitude"
- **Fantasy**: Daydreams about how thing should be or will be in the future, ignoring the current reality
  - "Escaping" into a fantasy of being a great pilot
- **Displacement**: Redirecting anger or frustration to someone or something else
  - A student who isn't angry with their instructor, but takes it out on their spouse or family

### Learner Reactions to Stress

Stress will cause a flight or fight response in the body

- Normal reactions to stress:
  - Normal individuals respond rapidly and exactly
  - They will utilize their training and experience
- Abnormal reactions to stress:
  - Inappropriate response to actions, like over-elation
  - Extreme over-cooperation
  - Painstaking self-control
  - Big changes in mood from lesson-to-lesson
  - Severe anger towards an instructor

## Learning Process

### Definition of Learning

- A process which results in a change in behavior, be it good or bad
- Gaining knowledge or skills through study, instruction, experience

### Perceptions

- Perceptions are the basis for learning
- The process of learning involved mapping new sensory input into useful information
- Learning can be better accomplished by utilizing more than one sense (e.g. sight, sound, touch)
- An instructor should guide a learner's perception onto the most important things

### Levels of Learning

- **R**: Rote / Memorization
  - The first attempt in acquiring knowledge
  - Memorization is quick, but lacks any depth and connection to other knowledge
- **U**: Understanding
  - The next stage of learning
  - Ability to make association between facts and procedures
  - Knowledge is organized in a useful way, with coherent groups of facts
  - "Mental model" or self-explanation
- **A**: Application
  - Applying and using the knowledge in a meaningful way
- **C**: Correlation / Concept Learning
  - Generalization of facts or steps into general concepts
  - Relies on categorization of knowledge into groups
  - Schemas are templates of thought that form when humans observe patterns

### Laws of Learning

- **R**: Readiness: Student must be ready to learn, want to learn, be properly motivated
- **E**: Exercise: Skills take rehearsal to master
- **E**: Effect: Successful experiences are more likely to be repeated, and thus better for learning
- **P**: Primary: Whatever is learned first will be learned strongest
- **I**: Intensity: Immediate, exciting, or dramatic experience will be more educational
- **R**: Recency: The more recent the information, the better it will be remembered

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-11](/_references/AIH/3-11)

### Characteristics of Learning

- **P**: Purposeful: Learners will want to see relevancy of the material
- **E**: Result of experience: Knowledge results from a bank of experience
- **M**: Learning is multifaceted: Learning involves many elements of experience, and not always what's intended by an instructor
- **A**: Active process: Learners must continuously react and respond to material and experiences to learn from it

### Transfer

#### Near/far

- Near transfer: applying information in a closely-related area
- Far transfer: applying information in a novel situation which share some common structure with the original scenario

#### Positive/negative

- Position transfer: When previous information aids in the learning and understanding of new information
  - Example: Using skills flying shallow turns to help with steep turns
- Negative transfer: When previous information conflicts or confuses the new skill or information
  - Example: Trying to steer on the ground with the yoke instead of the rudder pedals

### Learner Personalities

- Adult learners
  - Adults tend to be very goal-oriented
  - Adults tend to be self-directed and autonomous learners
  - Need to feel independent and in-control
  - Need to maintain self-esteem and self-image
  - Can tolerate longer blocks of instruction
- Self-directed
  - Can give them vague directions and let them work through
  - Like to see the practical relevance of presented material
- Young students
  - Young students tend to be more dependent on the instructor
  - Need specific directions and guidance
  - May require shorter block lengths of instruction
- Busy professionals
  - Busy professionals tend to be more self-directed, but have limited time
  - May have limited time to study and practice outside of lesson times
  - Can tolerate longer blocks of instruction
