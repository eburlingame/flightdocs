# High Altitude Operations

## Objective

To understand the physiology, equipment, and regulations regarding high altitude flights, including pressurization and oxygen systems.

## Motivation

High altitude flight presents unique risks and challenges that must be mitigated through various equipment requirements. A commercial pilot preparing to fly at high altitudes needs to understand the equipment and human factors involved.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Elements

- Altitude and air density
  - Hypoxia
  - Time of useful consciousness
  - Supplement oxygen
- Regulations
  - 91.211(a): Minimum oxygen requirements
  - 91.211(b): Pressurize aircraft oxygen requirements
- Supplement oxygen systems
  - Continuous flow systems
    - Constant flow
    - Adjustable flow
    - Altitude-compensated flow
  - Oxygen masks
    - Oronasal rebreather: Bag
    - Cannula
  - Electrical pulse-demand systems
  - Higher-altitude systems
    - Diluter-demand: Mask with tight seal
      - Generally good up to 40,000'
    - Pressure-demand
      - Allows for pressures above 40,000'
- Pulse oximeters
  - &gt;90 is good
- Pressurization
  - Principle of operation
  - Components of a pressurization system
    - Airtightness
    - Compressed air delivery
    - Controller to regular pressure
    - Safety dump valve
  - Turbo-charged pressurized aircraft
    - Regulator operation
    - Outflow valve
    - Dump valve
  - Cabin instrumentation
  - Decompression
    - Slow decompression: &lt; 10 sec
    - Rapid decompression: Lungs decompress faster than cabin
    - Explosive decompression: Cabin loses pressure faster than lungs can decompression (.2-.5s)
      - Lung damage
      - Hypoxia
      - Loss of consciousness
      - Decompression sickness
      - Fog, debris, noise
