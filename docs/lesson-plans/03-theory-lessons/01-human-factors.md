# Human Factors

## Objective

To become familiar with human and aeromedical factors that can affect flight safety, and apply corrective actions to mitigate them.

## Motivation

Understand the risks and mitigations for aeromedical factors that can effect flight safety, as they may happen to you, another pilot, or your passengers.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Elements

- Hypoxia
  - **Cause**: Hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs
  - **Symptoms**: Cyanosis, headache, dizziness, euphoria, impaired vision, drowsiness
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Use supplemental Oxygen
    - Fly lower
    - Address any pollution in the air
  - Time of useful consciousness
- Hyperventilation
  - **Cause**: Excessive rate and depth of respiration leading to abnormal loss of carbon dioxide
  - **Symptoms**: Rapid breathing, visual impairment, sweaty skin, dizziness
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Breath slowly
    - Speak something slowly
    - Breathe into a bag
- Middle ear and sinus problems
  - **Cause**: Blockage of the Eustachian tube which equalizes pressure between both sides of your ear drum. Often happens with inflammation
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Ear pain and pressure
    - Muffled hearing
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Valsalva method
    - Descend slowly
    - Decongestants for passengers
- Spatial disorientation
  - **Cause**: Disagreement or confusion between your sensory systems about the aircraft's position, attitude, or movement
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Confusion
    - Loss of airplane control
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Trust flight instruments
    - Limit maneuvering
    - Limit rapid head movements
- Illusions that contribute to spatial disorientation
  - The "leans"
  - Coriolis illusion
  - Graveyard spiral
  - Somatogravic illusion
  - Inversion illusion
  - Elevator illusion
- Motion sickness
  - **Cause**: The brain receiving conflicting messages about the state of the body's position in space.
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Nausea
    - Dizziness
    - Paleness, sweaty, clammy skin
    - Vomiting
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Fresh air
    - Focus on objects outside the airplane
    - Avoid unnecessary head movements
- Carbon monoxide poisoning
  - **Cause**: Hypemic hypoxia caused by the presence of CO in the air, which attaches to hemoglobin in the blood.
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Headache
    - Drowsiness
    - Blurred vision
    - Loss of muscle power
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Close header vent
    - Land and ventilate the cabin
    - Open fresh air vents
- Stress
  - **Cause**: The bodyâ€™s response to physical and psychological demands placed upon it. Stress can be chronic or acute.
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Agitation
    - Not thinking well
    - Fatigue
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Correct underlying stressors, which may require medical treatment for chronic stress
- Fatigue
  - **Cause**: Acute fatigue is caused by lack of sleep. Chronic fatigue usually has medical underpinnings.
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Drowsiness
    - Errors in judgment, timing, computation
    - Loss of muscle control
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Chronic fatigue: correct underlying issues, which may require medical attention
    - Acute fatigue: Rest
- Dehydration
  - **Cause**: Critical loss of water or electrolytes from the body
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Headache
    - Fatigue
    - Drowsiness
    - Cramps
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes
    - Drink before you become thirsty
- Hypothermia
  - **Cause**: Exposure to cold temperature for extended periods.
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Coldness
    - Shivering
    - Drowsiness
    - Loss of consciousness
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - Move to a warmer environment
    - Add clothing, blankets, or coats
    - Cover exposed areas
- Alcohol
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Symptoms similar to that of hypoxia
    - Impaired judgement, coordination, reaction time
  - Regulations
    - Alcohol, 14 CFR Part [91.17](/_references/14-CFR/91.17):
      - 8 hours "bottle to throttle"
      - 0.04% BAC limit
      - Cannot carry drunk passengers, except in an emergency
- Drugs
  - **Corrective Actions**
  - Regulations
    - 61.53 disallows a pilot from acting as PIC if:
      - They have any known medical condition that would make them ineligible for a medical
      - Are receiving treatment or taking medication that would make them ineligible for a medical
- Dissolved nitrogen in the bloodstream after SCUBA dives
  - **Cause**: Dissolved nitrogen in the blood being forced out of body
  - **Corrective Actions**
    - For flights below 8,0000' MSL:
      - At least **12 hours** after diving that does not require controlled ascent (non-decompression stop diving)
      - At least **24 hours** after diving that does require controlled ascent (decompression stop diving)
    - For flights above 8,000' MSL: At least **24 hours**
- IMSAFE checklist
- Optical Landing illusions
  - False Horizon
  - Runway Width Illusion
  - Sloping Terrain
  - Featureless Terrain
  - Water Refraction
  - Haze
  - Fog

## Questions

- You are flying at 7,500 feet and your passenger complains of fatigue and a headache.
- You are flying at 9,500 feet and your passenger is become abnormally euphoric and giddy.
- You want to take your three friends flying shortly after you receive your private pilot certificate. You're flying a Cessna 172, and from your weight and balance calculations, you know that the aircraft will be above gross weight with the four of them.
