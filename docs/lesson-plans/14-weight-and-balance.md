# Weight and Balance

## Objective

Understand the concept of weight and balance, the relationship of center of gravity on aircraft performance and limitations, and how to compute a weight and balance problem.

## Motivation

The effect of weight and CG location is critical to the safety of flight and an essential part of cross-country flight planning. Pilots should have a clear understand of the limits of their airplane with regards to weight and balance.

## Elements

### Weight and Balance Concepts

- Basic torque
  - Moment = weight \* radius (arm)
  - Moments are additive, we can sum them to determine total pitching moment
- Definitions
  - Datum: Fixed reference point to measure from, in the POH
  - Station: Area where item can be loaded (front seat, back seat, fuel tanks)
  - Arm: Distance from datum to the item
  - Moment: Item arm \* item weight
  - Center of Gravity: Location of new C.G. = Total moments / total weights
  - Loading Envelope: Graph of acceptable weight and CG ranges
- Types of weights
  - **Basic empty weight**
    - The standard empty weight plus the weight of optional and special equipment that have been installed
    - Includes all oil, fluids, and unusable fuel
  - **Standard empty weight**
    - All oil, fluids, and unusable fuel
    - This is the weight of the aircraft as it comes from the factory, with
      standard equipment installed
    - This is not normally used for weight and balance calculations
  - **Licensed empty weight**
    - Similar to standard empty weight for aircraft built before GAMA standardization of standard empty weight
    - Older term, does not include full engine oil
  - **Max ramp weight (MRW)**: The maximum weight for ground operations (no flight)
  - **Max takeoff weight (MTOW)**: Maximum weight for takeoff
  - **Max landing weight (MLW)**: Max weight for landing
- Common fluids
  - Fuel: 6 lbs / gallon

  - NW Airtech W&B Amendment: Empty weight, empty arm

  - Sample loading problem worksheet (POH pg. 112)

### Weight and Balance Sample Problem

- N2017E Problem A
  - Setup
    - Fuel: 50 gallons of 100LL
    - Pilot: 160lbs
    - Co-pilot: 180lbs
    - Rear passenger: 120lbs
    - Expected fuel burn during the flight: 40 gallons
  - What is the takeoff and landing weight?
  - What happens if we move our 180 passenger to the rear seats?
  - What happens if we add a forth passenger to the copilot seat who weighs 200?
  - Double checking our work in ForeFlight

### Effects of CG and Weight

- Over maximum weight
  - Longer takeoff roll
  - Longer landing roll
  - Slower rate of climb
  - Structural compromise
  - Potential damage on landing
- Loading fore/aft CG
  - Not enough elevator authority in slow or fast flight
  - CG Aft:
    - Less stable
    - Faster cruise speed
    - Limited forward elevator, may inhibit stall recovery
  - CG forward:
    - More stable
    - Slower
    - More elevator
    - Limited after elevator authority, may prevent adequate landing flare

## Questions

- You're planning a cross-country with a passenger who's new to flying. He brings 100lbs of baggage and want to put it in the back, which will put you aft of your CG limits. He says "there's plenty of room!"
  - How would you respond?
