## Elements

### Weight and Balance Concepts

- Basic torque
  - Moment = weight \* radius (arm)
  - Moments are additive, we can sum them to determine total pitching moment
- Definitions
  - Datum: Fixed reference point to measure from, in the POH
  - Station: Area where item can be loaded (front seat, back seat, fuel tanks)
  - Arm: Distance from datum to the item
  - Moment: Item arm \* item weight
  - Center of Gravity: Location of new C.G. = Total moments / total weights
  - Loading Envelope: Graph of acceptable weight and CG ranges
- Types of weights
  - Basic empty weight
    - The standard empty weight plus the weight of optional and special equipment that have been installed
    - Includes all oil, fluids, and unusable fuel
  - Standard empty weight
    - All oil, fluids, and unusable fuel
    - This is the weight of the aircraft as it comes from the factory, with
      standard equipment installed
    - This is not normally used for weight and balance calculations
  - Licensed empty weight
    - Similar to standard empty weight for aircraft built before GAMA standardization of standard empty weight
  - Max ramp weight: weight for taxi but not flight
  - Zero fuel weight: maximum authorized weight minus usable fuel
- Common fluids
  - Fuel: 6 lbs / gallon

### Weight and Balance Sample Problem

- N2017E Problem A
  - Setup
    - Fuel: 50 gallons of 100LL
    - Pilot: 160lbs
    - Co-pilot: 180lbs
    - Rear passenger: 120lbs
    - Expected fuel burn during the flight: 40 gallons
  - What is the takeoff and landing weight?
  - What happens if we move our 180 passenger to the rear seats?
  - What happens if we add a forth passenger to the copilot seat who weighs 200?
  - Double checking our work in ForeFlight

### Effects of CG and Weight

- Over maximum weight
  - Longer takeoff roll
  - Longer landing roll
  - Slower rate of climb
  - Structural compromise
  - Potential damage on landing
- Loading fore/aft CG
  - Not enough elevator authority in slow or fast flight
  - CG Aft:
    - Less stable
    - Faster cruise speed
    - Limited forward elevator, may inhibit stall recovery
  - CG forward:
    - More stable
    - Slower
    - More elevator
    - Limited after elevator authority, may prevent adequate landing flare
