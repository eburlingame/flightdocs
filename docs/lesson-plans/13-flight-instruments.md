# Flight Instruments and Avionics

## Objective

To understand the basic flight instruments used for flight and their common failure modes.

## Motivation

To a give a student an intuitive understanding of the operation of the flight instruments, and a sense of how they will behave if they malfunction.

## Format

- Slides

## Timing

30 minutes

## Elements

### Pitot-static instruments

- Operate on air pressure alone
- Static air pressure: Altimeter, VSI
- RAM air pressure: Airspeed indicator
  - Airspeed = (RAM air pressure - static pressure)
  - Operates with a diaphragm
- Types of airspeed
  - Indicated airspeed
  - Calibrated airspeed
  - True airspeed
  - Ground speed
- Airspeed indicator markings
- Pitot static blockages
  - RAM air block: Airspeed reads 0
  - RAM air and drain hole blocked: Airspeed reads whatever it was blocked (lower if descending, higher if ascending)
- Altimeter
  - Remember, pressure decreases at about 1 in Hg per 1000'
  - Converts ambient pressure into altimeter
  - Can be compensated for non-standard pressure
  - Effects of cold weather
- Vertical speed indicator
  - Derivative of the altimeter, the trend of the altitude
  - Consists of a diaphragm with a calibrated leak

### Vacuum-pressure/gyroscopic instruments

- Vacuum-driven gyroscopic system drive the attitude and heading indicators
- Sometimes the turn coordinator
- Attitude indicator
  - Two-axis gyros spinning 90 degrees to one another
- Heading indicator
  - Earth rotates in space at a rate of 15Â° in 1 hour
- Turn coordinator/inclinometer
- Vacuum/pressure gauge

### Other Instruments

- Magnetic compass
  - Turning errors
  - UNOS
  - ANDS
