# Lift, Drag, and Airfoils

## Objective

To understand basic aerodynamic concepts like lift, drag, and the nomenclature we use to describe it.

## Motivation

Forms foundational knowledge for more advanced aerodynamic topics and provides a useful mental model for pilots so they can better anticipate and understand the operation of an airplane.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Elements

### Basics

- Airplane component: Fuselage, wings, control
- Newton's laws of motion: Momentum, Fnet = mass \* acceleration, equal and opposite reaction
- Four forces of flight, equal in unaccelerated flight
- Airfoil and relative wind
- Theories of lift:
  - Bernoulli: low pressure above the wing
  - Newton: angle of attack
- Angle of attack
  - Different between *flight path* and *relative wind*
- Lift equation
- Critical angle of attack, stall
- Flight at slow airspeeds
- Basic torque
- Center of pressure vs center of gravity

### Thrust and Drag

- Engine provides thrust
- Drag works opposite
- Parasite drag
- Induced drag
  - Tilting of the lift vector
  - Wingtip vortices
- Parasite drag vs induced drag
- Best L/D, power required above and below
- Ground effect

### Wing Design

- Aspect ratio: Wing span to wing chord
  - Low aspect ratio: Concord, fighter jet
  - High aspect ratio: Glider
- Wing taper: more lift and less drag
- Wing loading: how much force each square foot of the wing needs to produce
