# Stability and Controllability

## Objective

To understand the effects of design choices on the stability of an aircraft along its three axes.

## Motivation

Helps a student develop an intuitive understanding of stability and controllability that they can use to make sense of the control inputs as they fly in different conditions.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Elements

### Stability

- Airplane axes: Longitudinal, lateral, vertical
- Static stability (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Will the system course-correct back to a neutral position when disturbed
  - Example: Ball in a halfpipe/flat surface, on a hill
- Dynamic stability (positive, negative, neutral)
  - After the system course-corrects, does it overshoot and continue to oscillate
  - Or, do the osculations dampen naturally
- Longitudinal / pitch stability: Tail downforce, thrust line
  - Elevator downforce in slow, level, and high speeds
- Lateral / roll stability
  - High wing: Pendulous effect / keel effect
  - Low wing: Dihedral, uncoordinated turn will make bigger AoA on down wing
  - Aerobatic planes: neutrally stable
- Vertical / yaw stability: Wind striking fuselage aft of CG
  - Rudder has it's own angle of attack
- Spiral instability vs Dutch roll

### Maneuverability

- Controllability is dependent Cp vs Cg
  - Elevator authority range shifts up/down with a fore/aft CG
- Maneuverability: How fast an aircraft can change its direction of flight or attitude
