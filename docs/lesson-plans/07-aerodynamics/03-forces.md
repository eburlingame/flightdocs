# Forces During Flight

## Objective

To understand the effects of the balance of forces on the airplane in different scenarios, and how turning tendencies impact the control of the airplane.

## Motivation

Helps a student develop an intuitive understanding of the turning forces present when flying so they can better anticipate and compensate for these forces.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Format

## Elements

### Turning Tendencies

1. Torque reaction of the propeller: torquing the airplane to roll to the left
2. Propeller slipstream/Spiraling slipstream
3. Gyroscopic precession
4. P-factor / Asymmetric Loading
   - With a high AOA, the "bite" of the downward moving blade is greater than the "bite" of the upward moving blade
   - Note this can reverse at low AoA, like in a decent

### Forces

- Forces in straight and level, unaccelerated flight [force vector diagram]
- Forces in a climb [force vector diagram]
- Forces in a decent [force vector diagram]
- Concept: Acceleration towards center of turn
  - "Centrifugal" force as a fictitious force
  - Constantly accelerating towards middle of turn
- Forces in a turn
  - Lift vector tilts towards center of turn
  - Need more lift to remain level
  - This lift means more load factor
  - For a level turn: Higher bank angle, higher load factor, and thus higher stalling speed
  - Stall speed vs bank angle graph
    - Beyond 50 degrees load factor in a level turn increases at a huge rate
- Adverse yaw in a turn
  - Downward aileron producing less lift, up aileron producing more
  - Slip vs skid: Too much rate of turn, too little rate of turn
