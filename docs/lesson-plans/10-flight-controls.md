# Flight Controls

## Objective

To understand the primary and secondary flight controls on an airplane, how they work, and how to use them.

## Motivation

Knowledge of the flight controls is important so a student can recognize abnormal operation, and they gain an intuitive understanding of their construction.

## Format

- Slides

## Timing

30 minutes

## Elements

- Three basic flight control: Elevator, aileron, and rudder
- Airplane rotates about its center of gravity
- Control surfaces are lifting surfaces, and require airspeed to function
- Ailerons: Control wheel, bank left or right
- Elevator: Control wheel, pitch up or down
  - Airplanes can also have a stabilator, where the entire surface moves
- Rudder: Yaw left or right
  - Most airplanes have brakes on the top of the rudder pedals
- Flaps
  - Increase chord of the wing, which increases angle of attack
  - Increases lift and increases drag
  - Useful when you want to descend without gaining airspeed, like during landing
  - Types of flaps
    - Some types produce more lift
    - Some types produce less pitching up movement when deployed
- Leading edge devices
  - Types of leading edge devices
  - Delay the separation of the boundary layer until a higher AoA
  - Slower stall speed and more lift
- Trim
  - Elevator trim
    - Can be a trim tab (e.g. Cessnas)
    - Anti-servo tab (e.g. Pipers)
      - Stabilators can produce a lot of force, so the antiservo tab counteracts the motion, making the controls less sensitive
      - They are still adjusted up/down with the trim control in the cockpit
  - Rudder trim
    - May be flight or ground adjustable
- Construction
  - Most flight controls are cable driven
  - Flaps are often driven by an electronic motor, or a manual rod
