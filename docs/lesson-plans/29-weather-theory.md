# Weather Theory

## Objective

To understand basic meteorology concepts that pertain to aviation, and how they related to the safety of flight.

## Motivation

It is important for a pilot to have an intuitive understand of basic weather phenomenons and hazardous weather to make good aeronautical decision.

## Elements

- Composition of the atmosphere
- Layers of the atmosphere
- Hot air = lower pressure = rises
- Ambient pressure: ~14.7 psi at sea level
- Barometer: Measures pressure
- International standard atmosphere is a common reference
- Barometric pressure decreases with altitude
  - On average, 1" Hg per 1000'
  - Wings, engine, propellers are all less efficient with less pressure
- Coriolis Force
  - Hot air means lower pressure: air rises
  - Radiation from the sun strikes the Earth strongly at the equator
  - Since the earth is rotating, this causes circular wind patterns
- In the northern hemisphere:
  - High to low pressure, clockwise: anticyclonic circulation
  - Low to high pressure, counterclockwise: cyclonic
- Surface pressure maps
  - Closer the contours: Greater the pressure differential
  - Surface wind speeds are less
- Convective heating of the air
  - Paved areas, plowed fields, dirt absorb and give off more heat quickly
  - Trees, water, vegetation give off heat more slowly
  - This uneven heating makes more warm pockets of air that cause turbulence
- Sea breeze vs land breeze
  - Sea breeze: Land heats quickly during the day, the air heats and rises, creating low pressure which draws cool air from the sea near the surface (on-shore breeze)
  - Land breeze: Land cools faster at night, so moist warm air over the water rises creating low pressure, which draws air off-shore (off-shore breeze)
- Turbulent flows created by obstructions
  - Near the ground: hangars, buildings
  - Mountains, ridges, bluffs
- Low-level wind shear
  - Microbursts: convective
  - Advisory Circular (AC) 00-54, FAA Pilot Wind Shear Guide
- Atmospheric stability
  - The ability of the atmosphere to resist or encourage vertical motion
  - Adibatic cooling: Air loses temperature as it rises, since the ambient pressure decreases
  - The average lapse rate is 2&deg; per 1000'
  - Moisture decrease air density. Moist air cools at a slower rate
  - The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 3 °C (5.4 °F) per 1,000 feet
  - In summary:
    - Cool, dry air is very stable and resists vertical movement
    - Warm, moist air produces the most instability
  - Temperature inversions: Layers where temperature _increases_ with altitude
    - Often occurs on clear, cool nights, when the ground cools the air above it
    - Can trap pollutants
  - Moisture
    - Every 20&deg;F increase in temperature increases the capacity of water the air can hold
    - The relative humidity is the percentage of water present vs the total amount the air could hold
    - Dewpoint is the point at which the air would be completely saturated by the current level of humidity
    - Clouds often form when unstable air rises and cools to the dewpoint
    - Saturated air bring clouds, fog, and precipitation
  - Dew and frost: form when surfaces cool beyond the dewpoint and water condenses on the side
  - Fog: Ground clouds that form when the ground temperature is low
    - Radiation fog: Clear, windless nights, the ground cools and cools the air above it
    - Advection fog: Warm, moist air moves over a colder surface at night. This requires wind (usually up to 15 knots) to move the air
    - Upslope fog: Forms when air is forced up a slope and cools
    - Steam fog: Cold, dry air moves over water
- Clouds
  - Three ingredients for clouds to form: Moisture, cooling, condensation nuclei
  - Moisture condenses onto minicsule particles of matter
  - Low clouds, middle clouds, high clouds
  - Towering cumulus clouds contain very turbulent air and potential for thunderstorms
- Air masses
  - Form from large "source regions", where conditions may develop for days (deserts, oceans, large lakes, polar caps)
  - Cold over warm: unstable
  - Warm over cold: stable
- Fronts
  - Fronts are boundaries between two different air masses
    - As a front pass, the pressure will rise and climb, the temperature will change, and the wind direction will change
  - Warm front
    - Warm, often moist air that slides slowly over a colder air mass (shallow frontal slope)
    - Ahead of the front, cirriform or stratiform clouds and light precipitation
    - Poor visibility, haze as the front passes
  - Cold front
    - Cold, dense, stable air advances and quickly slide under and replaces a warmer air mass (steep frontal slope)
    - Prior the passage of a warm front, cumulonimbus clouds are common
    - A fast-moving cold front may produce a concentrated band of precipitin and thunder storms
    - Squall lines may form ahead of a fast-moving cold front
  - Stationary front
    - Air masses with relatively equal forces can remain stationary for several days
    - Weather is a mixture of cold front/warm front conditions
  - Occluded front
    - Occurs when a cold front overtakes a slow-moving warm front
    - Cold-front occlusion: Fast-moving cold front air is colder than the cooler air ahead of the warm front
      - Mixture of cold/warm front weather, relatively stable
    - Warm-front occlusion: Fast-moving cold front air is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front
      - The cold front "rides up" over the warm front, and instability occurs. This can sauce severe thunderstorms, rain, and fog
- Thunderstorms
  - Three things for a thunderstorm for form:
    - Instability
    - Lifting action
    - Moisture
  - Three distinct stages:
    - Cumulus stage: Air rises, strong updrafts occur
    - Mature stage:
      - Moisture is too heavy for cloud to support, precipitation starts falling, this causes a downdraft
      - Vertical motion is stalled, and top of the cloud forms the anvil shape
    - Dissipating stage:
      - Downdrafts spread and replace updrafts
  - Hazards
    - Heavy rain
    - Engine water ingestion
    - Hail which may be thrown miles from the storm
    - Violent turbulence in the storm and in the vicinity
    - Wind shear turbulence and microbursts near the surface
    - Supercooled water droplets that can freeze on impact with an airplane
    - Lightning can be temporarily blinding and induce radio interference and magnetic compass errors
  - Thunderstorm avoidance
    - It is impossible to fly over most thunderstorms, especially in the light aircraft
    - Circumnavigate a thunderstorm radar echo by at least 20nm
- Mountain wave
  - Occurs with increasing wind gradient as altitude increases
  - Wind imparts a "ripple" effect on the slope
