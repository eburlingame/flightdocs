## Elements

- What is a holding pattern? When would we use one?
  - A holding a pttern is a racetrack pattern in the sky which is used for delaying aircraft or for getting turned around onto a separate course
    - Standard holds: _right turns_
    - Non-standard holds: _left turns_
- Components of a holding pattern [Draw a holding pattern]
  - Holding fix
  - Inbound course, inbound segment
  - Output course
  - Standard-rate turns
- Holding instructions
  1. Direction of holding from the fix in terms of the 8 cardinal compass points (N, NE, E, SE, etc.)
  2. Holding fix
  3. Radial, course, bearing, airway, or route on which the aircraft is to hold
  4. Leg length in miles, if DME or RNAV is to be used
  5. Direction of turns, if left turns are to be made
  6. Time to EFC (expect further clearance) and any pertinent additional delay info
- Hold clearance examples
  - "Hold as published on the ARTTY intersection, expect further clearance at 15:30Z"
  - "Hold east of the UGB VOR on the 090&deg; radial, expect further clearance at 15:30Z"
    - No leg length was given, so 1 minute turns are expected
  - "Hold north on the 180 radial of the SHEDD intersection, left turns 4nm legs."
- Hold entries
  - Start with a hold and draw the racetrack: VOR, hold south on the 240 radial
  - Always start 
  - Direct
  - Parallel
  - Teardrop
- Flying a hold
  - VOR hold
  - DME hold
  - RNAV hold
- Wind correction
- Lost comms procedure
