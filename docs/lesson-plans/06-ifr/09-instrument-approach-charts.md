### What is an instrument approach?

An instrument approach is a procedure which can be used to place the aircraft in a position from where it can land at an airport.

Enroute phase > arrival phase > approach phase > landing

Two broad categories of approaches: Approaches with vertical guidance, approaches without vertical guidance

### Structure of an IAP

- Transition routes, how do we get established on the approach
- Final approach segment with some kind of guidance (ILS, VOR, GPS)
- Decision point: A point where we decide whether we are going to continue to land
  - This decision is supported by a set of minimums, which tells us the altitude and visibility we need to have the runway in sight, and be able to land safely
- Missed approach procedure with a hold

### Chart Components

Non-precision approach example: [KCVO VOR RWY 17](https://www.airnav.com/depart?http://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2509/00782VA.PDF)

- Margin identification
  - City/State (top L)
  - Identifier and responsible agency (top C)
  - Last update date (top R)
  - Volume ID of TPP, effective dates (left C)
  - Procedure title (bottom R)
    - Typically with name of runway ILS 31
    - "VOR-A": Not aligned with a runway
    - RNAV 31 Z, Y: Multi approaches
  - Airport name (bottom R)
- Briefing strip
  - Primary navaid: Frequency and channel (military user)
    - RNAV approaches will also have "WAAS" here for LP/LPV
  - Approach course: Magnetic course, altitude, distance
  - Runway length: 5100
  - Touchdown zone elevation: TDZE
  - Airport elevations
  - Procedure notes:
    - Non-standard takeoff mins
    - Non-standard alternate mins
    - What if there's an acronym here you don't recognize? TPP legend
  - Missed approach procedure
  - Frequencies
    - Star next to com frequency: Indicates part-time tower ops
    - Inverse L: Pilot controlled lighting
- Planview
  - IAF: Initial approach fix, where the approach can be start
  - IF: Intermediate fix - indicates we are on _intermediate segment_, aligned with the runway
  - MSA: Minimum safe altitudes, for emergencies (+1000' clearance over all obstructions)
  - Obstruction: +/- means "doubtful accuracy"
  - "RADAR REQUIRED"
  - Marker beacon: Outer, middle, and inner
- Profile view
  - Approach descent angle: 3.2, TCH = Threshold crossing height
  - FAF: Maltese cross
  - Missed approach point: For non-precision it is the last waypoint
  - VDP: V symbol near the runway, point at which the approach descent angle from the touchdown zone intercepts the MDA
- Airport sketch
  - Lighting systems
    - See [Approach Lighting Systems](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap2_section_1.html)
    - MALSR: Medium-intensity approach lighting system
    - V = VASI
    - A5 = 5 lead-in strobes
    - Inverted V and A5 = pilot controlled lighting
  - Timing stable for different ground speeds
    - Used for timing the missed approach point
- Landing minimums
  - Airport categories: VREF or 1.3 \* VS0
    - A: Less than 91 knots
    - B: 91 knots - 120 knots
    - C: 121 knots - 140 knots
    - D: 141 knots - 165 knots
    - E: 166 knots or more
    - See TPP supplement pg. 4 for category speeds
  - "S-ILS 33L" - Straight in for 33L
  - Altitude and visibility requirements
    - Big numbers:
      - Minimum descent altitude (MDA) or decision altitude (DA)
      - Minimum visibility in s.m.
      - RVR in 100's of feet, can be converted to s.m. (TPP supplement pg. 5) - See KSLE RNAV 31 for RVR
    - Small numbers: MDA/DA in height about runway threshold

#### VDPs

- Used on non-precision approach charts
- Tells you the last point where a descent to the runway can be made at the established (often, but not always, aligning with the angle of the PAPI/VASI)
- For 3째 slope: (Minimum descent height) / 300 = Distance in nm to VDP
- Example: KCVO VOR 17
  - VASI 3째 angle: (632 MDH) / 300 = 2.1nm
  - Approach angle 3.2째: (632 / 354) = 1.8
- Depending on our aircraft, we should treat the VDP as the MAP

  - A 172 may be able to make a safe approach and landing at >3째 descent angle
  - A Cirrus or a King Air should probably make a missed approach
  - Reminder that we need to land using normal maneuvers

- Precision approach chart: [KMFR ILS or LOC RWY 14](https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2510/00251IL14.PDF)
- Procedure turn example: KSPB VOR-A
- Hold-in-lieu of procedure turn example: KSLE RNAV 31

### Briefing an approach

Basic flow: Top left to bottom rate of the chart
Example: KSLE RNAV 31, DIYAT to NECIP, LPV

- Confirm approach name and chart currency
- NAVAIDs: Tune and identify
- Landing distance available, TDZE, airport elevation
- Procedure notes: Inoperative equipment
- Approach lighting system
- Tune COM frequencies
- Brief procedure entry
  - Set procedure course in OBS
  - Describe the procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of procedure turn
  - Initial altitude restrictions
- Brief minimums for approach speed
- Missed approach procedure
- Any questions?
