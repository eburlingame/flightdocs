# Navigation Systems

## Objective

To understand how the navigation systems installed in our aircraft work and how to use them to navigate, also to understand radar services that are available to us.

## Motivation

Pilots rely on navigation systems to fly to unfamiliar locations, making it essential for cross-country flying. Understanding radar services provided by ATC is also important for safety and efficiency.

## Timing

1 hour

## Format

  - Air Traffic Control Radar
  - Radar Services
  - Flight Following Radio Calls

## Questions

- You tune a VOR and ID the station, only to find there's no morse code being transmitted on the station's frequency.
  - What does this mean? What would you use instead?
- The Olympia airport (KOLM) has a High power VOR that you plan to use in your flight plan. Your planning to cruise at 4500'.
  - Will you be able to reliably use the VOR signal from 100nm away? What about 50nm?
- You're using VFR flight following, and they asked you to climb to 4500' for traffic. The cloud bases are around 4000'.
  - What would you do?
