# Airspace: Weather Minimums

## Objective

Identify class airspace on a sectional chart and describe any weather, equipment, or speed restrictions needed to operate within the airspace. Also determine what pilot qualifications are needed for each class.

## Motivation

Each class of airspace has different weather minimums for VFR flight, equipment requirements, speed limits, and pilot qualification. A pilot will need to know and apply these rules before flying into any airspace.

## Timings

45 minutes

## Format

- Whiteboard / EFB

## Elements

### VFR Weather Minimums

### Special VFR (91.157)

- Allows you to operate in controlled airspace when the weather is less than basic VFR (3 s.m. day / 5 s.m. night)
- An ATC clearance is required, even in Class E airspace
  - Tower, FSS, center can give you clearance
- Special VFR allows for flight:
  - During the day: 1 s.m. and clear of clouds
  - At night: 1 s.m. and clear of clouds
    - But: must be IFR rated, equipped, and current

## U.S. ADIZ

- Requires a Defense VFR (DVFR) flight plan

### Speed Limits

- Above 10,000': **Mach 1** ([91.817](/_references/14-CFR/91.817))
- Below 10,000': **250 KIAS** ([91.117](/_references/14-CFR/91.117))
- In Class B airspace: **250 KIAS** ([91.117](/_references/14-CFR/91.117))
- Under Class B or in Class B corridor: **200 KIAS** ([91.117](/_references/14-CFR/91.117))
- Within 4nm of primary Class C or D airport, up to 2500 AGL: **200 KIAS** ([91.117](/_references/14-CFR/91.117))

### ADS-B Requirements

- In Class A airspace.
- Required within the Mode C veil of Class B airspace.
- Above and Below Class B airspace.
- In Class C airspace and above Class C airspace.
- In Class E airspace at and above 10,000 MSL.
- Within 12 NM of the US coastline in the Gulf of Mexico in Class E airspace at and above 3,000 MSL

## Pilot Certificates

- Class B airspace: Open to private and above, except:
  - Student pilots nee a endorsement for the specific airspace (61.95)
  - Recreational and sport pilots need a one-time endorsement for all Class B airspace
  - Some Class B airports (listed in Part 91, Appendix D) will require a PPL minimum

## Questions

- An localized bank of stratus clouds are over your airport at 900 ft. AGL, but there are clear skies to the west. The clouds are forecast to dissipate as the day warms up
  - Assuming you're departing from an airport with a control tower, is there any way you can depart?
- You plan to cruise at 4,500 feet to your destination, just below a bank of overcast clouds at 4800 feet.
  - Is this legal? Is there anything you would be concerned about?
- You want to practice landings in the traffic pattern at an uncontrolled airport in Class G airspace. The AWOS is reporting 1100 ft. overcast with ground visibility of 1.5 s.m.
  - Are you legal to fly in the traffic pattern? Is it a good idea?
- You are approaching to land at an airport AWOS says the surface visibility is 2.5 s.m. 4 miles from the airport you have the runway in sight.
  - Are you able to land legally?
