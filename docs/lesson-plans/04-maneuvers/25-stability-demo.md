# Stability Demonstration

## Yaw Stability

- Establish S&L flight, trimmed out
- Make a significant depression on the left or right rudder
- Release and observe how the airplane reestablishes straight flight
- Use the analogy of an arrow that wants to fly straight

## Roll Stability

- Establish a small bank (&lt; 10 &deg;)
- Release controls and observe how airplane slows comes back to level
- Notice how this doesn't happen with banks angles &gt;20&deg;

## Pitch Stability

- Raise the nose slightly and release it
- Observe the airplane
  - Slow down and lower the nose
  - Speed back up and raise the nose
- The pitch oscillations slowly damper out, returns us back to our level pitch attitude
