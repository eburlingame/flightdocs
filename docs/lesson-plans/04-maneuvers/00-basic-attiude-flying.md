# Basic Attitude Flying

## Straight and Level Flight

- If needed, cover all primary instruments except the VSI
- Establish S&L flight and have the student note the position of the cowling vs the horizon
- Nose up to a V<sub>Y</sub> pitch attitude, note the airplane is climbing
- Nose down to a 500 fpm descent, note the airplane is descending
- Have the student try S&L, gently nose-up climb and nose-down descent

## Level Turns

- Demonstrate a level turn, have the student note where the cowling hits the horizon on the left and right
- Demonstrate a turn with nose too high, note that the airplane climbs
- Demonstrate a turn with nose too low, note that the airplane descends
- Explain that we need a little bit of rudder to get us into the turn and get us out of the turn
  - We need more rudder on the right than on a left turn
- Have the student try gentle turns and find the level turn attitude

## Climbs

- Demonstrate a V<sub>Y</sub> pitch attitude with climb power, have the student note the horizon vs the cowling
- Return to level flight and have the student try establishing a V<sub>Y</sub> climb
  - Handle the throttle setting for the student so they can focus outside
- Demonstrate a V<sub>X</sub> pitch attitude with climb power, have the student note the horizon vs the cowling
- Return to level flight and have the student try establishing a V<sub>X</sub> climb
  - Handle the throttle setting for the student so they can focus outside

## Descents

- Establish a 500 fpm descent with typical descent power, have the student note the horizon vs the cowling
- Return to level flight
- Have the student establish a descending pitch attitude
  - Handle throttle setting for the student
