# Collision Avoidance

## Objective

To develop a pilot's systematic approach to visual scanning and collision avoidance.

## Motivation

See-and-avoid is the primary method by which VFR pilots will maintain separation from other aircraft. A pilot should develop effective habits when scanning for other aircraft.

## Timing

45 minutes

## Format

## Elements

- Vision and pilot's physical condition
- Conditions which degrade vision
- "See and avoid"
- Scanning procedure
- Poor visual scanning and collision risk
- Clearing procedures
- Aircraft blind spots
- Aircraft speed and collision rise
- Situations with the greatest collision risk
- TIS-B and ADS-B
