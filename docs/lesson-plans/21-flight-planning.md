# Flight Planning

## Objectives

To understand the concepts behind pilotage, dead reckoning, radio, and GPS navigation, and effectively apply that knowledge on a cross-county flight.

## Motivations

## Timings

- 2 hours

## Format

## Elements

- Selecting an airport to fly to
  - Runway lengths
  - Weather services
  - FBOs
- Selecting a route to get there
  - Terrain and obstructions
  - MEFs
  - Airspace
  - Waypoints: Good, easy to find waypoints
- VFR cruising altitudes
- Altitude planning
  - Top of climb
  - Top of descent
- Finalizing our flight plan
  - Waypoints, altitude
  - Altitudes
  - Courses: True course, magnetic course
- NWKRAFT - ([91.103](/_references/14-CFR/91.103))
  - NOTAMs
  - Weather
  - Known ATC delays
  - Runway lengths
  - Fuel requirements
  - Alternates available
  - Takeoff and landing distances
- Navigation
  - Pilotage: Waypoints
  - Dead-reckoning
  - Radio navigation
  - GPS
- Navigation log
  - Using a winds aloft forecast
  - Computing leg data
    - Course
    - Distance
    - TAS
    - Wind
    - CAS
    - True course
    - True heading
    - Magnetic heading
    - Compass heading
    - Ground speed
    - ETE
    - Fuel
- Flight planning with ForeFlight
  - Airplane profiles: Basic vs Advanced
  - Differences between manual navlog and ForeFlight
- Weather briefing
  - ForeFlight
  - [1800wxbrief.com](https://www.1800wxbrief.com/Website/#!/)
  - Record of your briefing is kept
- UTC time conversion
- Flight Plan
  - Activating a flight plan
  - Closing a flight plan
  - Search and rescue
- Flying our flight plan
  - Pilotage: Look out the window
  - Dead reckoning: Speed \* time = distance
  - Radio navigation
- Noting the times of each of our waypoints
  - Noting time off the ground
  - Top of climb time
  - Waypoint time
- VOR and DME navigation
  - Morse code identifier
  - Limited by line-of-sight, works better the higher you go
  - Flying to a VOR:
    1. Tune the station
    2. Identify the station
    3. Center the CDI with a TO indication
    4. Turn to the course shown, bracketing for wind
- GPS navigation
- Lost procedures
  - Climb, Communicate, Confess, Comply
- Diverting to an alternate
