# Airfoils

## Newton's Third Law

- For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- In an airplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the air
- Consequently, the air pushes the propeller and the airplane forward

## Bernoulli's Law

- As the pipe constricts, the pressure and the velocity must increase
- An increase in velocity means a decrease in pressure / a decrease in velocity means a increase in pressure

- The same principle applies to an airfoil
  - Some air is directed above the wing, some is directed below it
  - An increase in velocity decreases the pressure above the wing, which causes a force vertically on the wing
