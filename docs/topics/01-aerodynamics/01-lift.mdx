# Lift

Lift is a force that is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the
airfoil, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the center of lift
(CL) and perpendicular to the lateral axis.

All other factors being constant, for every angle-of-attack (AOA) there is a
corresponding airspeed required to maintain altitude in steady, unaccelerated
flight.

As airspeed increase, lift also increases. If the angle of attack were held
constant, and the aircraft speed up, the lift would increase and the aircraft
would climb as a result of the increased lifting force. Therefore, to keep the
aircraft straight and level (not accelerating upward), lift must be kept
constant by reducing the AOA (usually lowering the nose).

## Lift equation

$$
\text{lift} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S C_l}{2}
$$

$$
\text{Where:}\\
\rho = \text{air density}\\
V = \text{velocity}\\
S = \text{surface area}\\
C_l = \text{coefficient of lift}
$$

Note that lift will increase with the square of the velocity.
