# Visual Illusions

## False Horizon

Several phenomena can create a visual line that a pilot might mistake for a
horizon.

- These can include:
  - A sloping cloud formation
  - An obscured horizon
  - An aurora borealis
  - A dark scene spread with ground lights and stars
  - Certain geometric patterns of ground lights

## Runway Width Illusion

- A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a
  **higher** altitude than it actually is
- Likewise, a wider-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft
  is at a **lower** altitude than it actually is

## Sloping Terrain

- An upsloping runway or upsloping terrain can create an illusion that the
  aircraft is at a **higher** altitude than it actually is
- A downsloping runway or downsloping terrain can create an illusion that the
  aircraft is at a **lower** altitude than it actually is

## Featureless Terrain

An absence of surrounding ground features, for instance a dark overwater
approach, or featureless terrain from snow, can create an illusion that the
aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is.

This is sometimes called a “black hole approach,” and causes pilots to fly a
lower approach than is desired.

## Water Refraction

Rain on the windscreen can create an illusion of being at a higher altitude due
to the horizon appearing lower than it is. This can result in the pilot flying a
lower approach.

## Haze

Atmospheric haze can create an illusion of being at a greater distance and
height from the runway.

## Fog

Flying into fog can create an illusion of pitching up. Pilots who do not
recognize this illusion often steepen the approach abruptly.
