# Flaps

![Flap types](/img/content/flap-types.png)

1. Plain flap
   - Increases camber of the wing
   - Creates drag
   - Moves center of pressure backwards
   - Creates nose-down pitching moment
2. Split flap
   - Deflects
   - More lift than a plain flap
   - Same amount of drag as plain flap
3. Slotted flap
   - Most common type of flap
   - Like a split flap, but there's a gap between the wing and the flap
   - Slot energizes boundary layer behind the flap, which delays the critical AoA before stall
   - Can have multiple slots
4. Fowler flap
   - Flaps which "slide" down and back from the wing
   - Common on airliners
   - Increase wing surface area
   - Small deflection adds lift
   - End of the deflection is mostly drag
5. Slotted fowler flap
   - Combines the advantages of fowlers and slotted flaps
