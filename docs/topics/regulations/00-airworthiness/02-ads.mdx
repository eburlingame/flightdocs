# Airworthiness Directives

Airworthiness directives (ADs) are used to communicate unsafe operating
conditions related to aircraft and aircraft equipment.

They are mandatory in nature and must be complied with for aircraft to remain
airworthy.

There are two types of ADs:

- Emergency issue: Addressing a urgent, safety-of-flight issue
- Normal issue: Less urgent issue, usually requires compliance within a
  specified period

## AD Compliant Records

- An AD compliance record is a report compiled based on the serial number and options of the aircraft
- This report contains what ADs the airframe needs to be compiled with
- AD Entries need to contain:
  - AD Number
  - How it was compiled with
  - When it will be due again

# Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins

Special Airworthiness Information Bulletins (SAIBs) are alerts and
recommendations published by the FAA. They are non-regulatory in nature, and do
not meet the criteria for an AD.
