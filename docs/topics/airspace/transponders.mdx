# Transponder and ADS-B Requirements

For the airspace listed below, aircraft are required to have a Mode S or
transponder (used on advanced aircraft for TCAS), or Mode C transponder with
pressure altitude encoding.

And an ADS-B out source operating on:

- 1090 MHz Extended Squitter (TSO-C166b)
- 978 MHz Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) (TSO-C154c)

<Reg part="91.215(b)" />
<Reg part="91.225(a)" />

## Transponder Operation

If you have an operational transponder and ADS-B out solution, then it must be
operated at all times in controlled airspace.

<Reg part="91.215(c)" />
<Reg part="91.225(f)" />

## Required Airspace

- Within Class A, B and C airspace
- Above the lateral bounds of Class B and C airspace
- Within 30nm of a Class B airport (the Mode C Veil), up to 10,000' MSL
- At and above 10,000' MSL over the contiguous states, excluding the airspace at
  and below 2,500' AGL
- Class E airspace at and above 3000' MSL, over the Gulf of Mexico from the
  coastline of the United States out to 12 nautical miles

## Exceptions

Aircraft that were not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical
system or which has not subsequently been certified with such a system
installed, balloon, or glider.

## ATC Deviations

ATC deviations from these requirement (for both Mode C transponder and ADS-B
out), can be made in several scenarios:

- If you have an operational transponder that isn't Mode C, you can request a
  deviation at any time
- If you have an inoperative transponder/ADS-B out source, and you are
  travelling to a destination (including any intermediate stops) where repairs
  can be made, you can request a deviation at any time
- If your aircraft is not equipped with a transponder or ADS-B position source,
  you can request a deviation at least **1 hour** before your proposed operation
