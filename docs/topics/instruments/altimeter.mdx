# Sensitive Altimeters

Airplanes are almost always equipped with an _sensitive altimeter_ which display
altitude based on the ambient air pressure from the static port.

## Altimeter Errors

Because the altimeter is a pressure instrument, it is subject to errors when the
external pressure changes. This can be the result of lower or higher atmospheric
pressure, or be caused by difference in air pressure.

- With regard to temperature:
  - When the air is _warmer_ than standard, the pressure is higher
    - The altimeter reads _lower_ than you are actually flying
    - You have a tendency to fly higher than you expect
  - When the air is _colder_ than standard, the pressure is lower
    - The altimeter will read _lower_ than you are actually flying
    - You have a tendency to fly lower than you expect
- With regards to pressure:
  - When the air has _higher_ pressure than standard, the altimeter will read
    _lower_ than you are actually flying
  - When the air has _lower_ pressure than standard, the altimeter will read
    _higher_ than you are actually flying

> Remember "high to low, look out below", and "from hot to cold, don't be bold."
