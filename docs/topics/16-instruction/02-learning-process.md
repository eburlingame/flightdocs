# The Learning Process

## Definition of Learning

- A process which results in a change in behavior
- Gaining knowledge or skills through study, instruction, experience

## Characteristics of Learnings

PEMA:

- **P**urposeful
- Result of **E**xperience
- **M**ultifaceted
- **A**ctive process

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-2](/_references/AIH/3-2)

## Behaviorism

- Explains behavior in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli
- Human behavior is conditioned by events in the person's environment
- Based on this theory is the simple "carrot-and-stick" approach to learning

## Cognitive Theory

- Focuses on what's going on inside the mind
- Examine's the human ability to reflect, problem solve, and think critically

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-2](/_references/AIH/3-2)

## Social Learning

Social learning is simply learning by observation of others. Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory has four stages:

1. Attention - ability to observe others them
2. Retention - remember the observed behavior
3. Reproduction - reproduce a previous observed behavior, may require addition skills
4. Motivation - a reason to reproduce the behavior

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-3](/_references/AIH/3-3)

## Learning Theories

1. Classical conditioning: Pavlovian psychology, association with stimuli
2. Operant conditioning: Associations are made between positive behaviors and positive consequences, negative behaviors and negative consequences
3. Social learning: Watching, imitating the actions of others

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-3](/_references/AIH/3-3)

### Bloom's Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domains

![Bloom's Taxonomy](images/image-1.png)

1. Comprehension
2. Application
3. Analysis
4. Synthesis
5. Evaluation
6. Knowledge

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-5](/_references/AIH/3-5)

### Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

- Higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), also called aeronautical decision-making (ADM)
- Based on the last three of Bloom's Taxonomy (synthesis, evaluation, knowledge)
- Progress learning from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract

## Scenario-Based Training (SBT)

- Use of structured, "real-world" scenarios to approach flight-training objectives
- Helps student's "make meaning" out of their past experiences, and use that to strengthen their ADM

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-6](/_references/AIH/3-6)

[Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge pg. 2-21](/_references/PHAK/2-21)

## Perceptions

![Perceptions graph](images/image-2.png)

- Perceptions are the basis for learning
- The process of learning involved mapping new sensory input into useful information
- Learning can be better accomplished by utilizing more than one sense (e.g. sight, sound, touch)
- An instructor should guide a learner's perception onto the most important things

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-7](/_references/AIH/3-7)

### Factors that Affect Perception

- Physical organism
  - The physical apparatuses for sensing the world around us
- Goals and values
  - Sensory input is colored by one's own beliefs and values, goals are the produce of one's value structure
- Self-concept
  - Self image (e.g. confident, insecure), affects a persons perception
  - Negative experiences can contradict a person's self-concept
- Time and opportunity
  - We need time and practice to develop perception of something
- Element of threat
  - Fear adversely affects perception by narrowing the perceptual field
  - An overwhelming situation can be threatening
  - If a learner feels they can handle a situation, then it's viewed as a challenge

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-7](/_references/AIH/3-7)

## Insight

- Insight involves the grouping of perceptions into meaningful wholes
- It is the instructor's job to facilitate the synthesis of perceptions into insights

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-9](/_references/AIH/3-9)

## Selective Attention

- Over time, student will learn which sensory inputs to focus on and which ones to filter out

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-36](/_references/AIH/3-36)

## Levels of Learning

- **R**: Rote / Memorization
  - The first attempt in acquiring knowledge
  - Memorization is quick, but lacks any depth and connection to other knowledge
- **U**: Understanding
  - The next stage of learning
  - Ability to make association between facts and procedures
  - Knowledge is organized in a useful way, with coherent groups of facts
  - "Mental model" or self-explanation
- **A**: Application
  - Applying and using the knowledge in a meaningful way
- **C**: Correlation / Concept Learning
  - Generalization of facts or steps into general concepts
  - Relies on categorization of knowledge into groups
  - Schemas are templates of thought that form when humans observe patterns

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-9](/_references/AIH/3-9)

## Laws of Learning

- **R**: Readiness: Student must be ready to learn, want to learn, be properly motivated
- **E**: Exercise: Skills take rehearsal to master
- **E**: Effect: Successful experiences are more likely to be repeated, and thus better for learning
- **P**: Primary: Whatever is learned first will be learned strongest
- **I**: Intensity: Immediate, exciting, or dramatic experience will be more educational
- **R**: Recency: The more recent the information, the better it will be remembered

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-11](/_references/AIH/3-11)

## Domains of Learning

- Cognitive: Recall, understanding, application
- Psychomotor: Doing, observation, habit
- Affective: Beliefs and attitudes, emotions towards the experience

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-13](/_references/AIH/3-13)

## Characteristics of Learning

- **P**: Purposeful: Learners will want to see relevancy of the material
- **E**: Result of experience: Knowledge results from a bank of experience
- **M**: Learning is multifaceted: Learning involves many elements of experience, and not always what's intended by an instructor
- **A**: Active process: Learners must continuously react and respond to material and experiences to learn from it

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-19](/_references/AIH/3-19)

## Learning Styles

- Left/Right brain:
  - Left brain: step-by-step, writing, plans, structured analytical
  - Right brain: Coordinated, creative, impulsive, open-ended questions, responds well to demonstrations
- Reflective/Impulsive
  - Reflective individuals will think deeply before acting, considering all possibilities
  - Impulsive individual will act from impulse, quick assessments
- Holist/Serialist
  - Holist: Top-down learners, want to see the big picture
  - Serialist: Bottom-up learners, concentrates on one stage at a time
- Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic
  - Auditory: Learn best from listening
  - Visual: Learn best from images
  - Kinesthetic: Learn by hands-on doing

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-20](/_references/AIH/3-20)

## Acquiring Skill Knowledge

### Stages of Skill Acquisition

1. Cognitive stage: Based in factual knowledge, memorization, fixations
2. Associate stage: Practice mode, associate task elements together, make assessments of their own progress
3. Automatic response stage: Perform skills automatically and can multi-task, skill is rapid and smooth

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-24](/_references/AIH/3-24)

### Knowledge of Results

- Give feedback early and often, whether the learner's performance is good or bad
- The student should be learning how to judge their own performance

### How to Develop Skills

- Transition skills from effortful to automatic requires repeated practice
- The first few attempts will be awkward and slow

### Learning Plateaus

- Plateaus can be caused by
  - consolidation of other skills
  - waning interest
  - reaching of cognitive capability limits
  - the need for a more efficient method of practice

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-26](/_references/AIH/3-26)

## Types of Practice

1. Deliberate practice:
   - Practice with a specific goal in mind
   - Usually done with an instructor giving immediate feedback
2. Blocked practice:
   - Practicing skills repeatedly in a block of time
   - Utilized short-term memory, which is only useful for the time in the block
   - Not as useful for developing long-term skills
3. Random practice:
   - Practices a random set of skills
   - The most valuable type of practice

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-26](/_references/AIH/3-26)

## Evaluation vs Critique

- Critique, or suggestions are used early in the training
- Over-learning involves continued study after proficiency has been achieved
  - Sometimes concepts can give way to rote procedure if not engaged with (like a checklist becoming rote)
- Learners not only need a skill to become easy or habitual, but know when to apply the skill or knowledge

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-28](/_references/AIH/3-28)

## Putting it all together

- Multitasking: Attention switching, simultaneous performance
- Distractions and interruptions should be minimized early in training, but added in as the student progresses
- Fixation and inattention: A tendency to over- or under-observe a particular piece of information

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-29](/_references/AIH/3-29)

## Errors

- Slip: a person plans to do the _right_ thing, but does something else
- Mistake: A person plans to do the _wrong_ thing

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-33](/_references/AIH/3-33)

### Ways to minimize errors

1. **Take more time**
2. **Check for errors deliberately**
3. **Use reminders** like checklists and automation
4. **Develop routines** to prevent the error
5. **Raise awareness** when a person know an error is likely

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-33](/_references/AIH/3-33)

### Learning from errors

- Instructors should give students ways to recover from errors
- Point out errors and ask student why they occurred
- Point out that errors occur at all skill levels

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-35](/_references/AIH/3-35)

## Memory

> Memory is the vital link between the learning retaining information and the cognitive process of applying what has been learned.

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-35](/_references/AIH/3-35)

### Sensory memory:

- Receives initial stimuli from the environment
- Processes information according to what the person deems important (discarding what is deemed extraneous)

### Working or short-term memory

- Information stored for roughly 30 seconds
- Limited to about 7 "chunks" of information
- Additional effort required to transition information into long-term memory
  - This is called the coding or chunking process
  - Rehearsal can help convert into LTM

### Long-term memory

- Long term memory is theoretically infinite and permanent
- During the encoding process, information should be contextualized with other memories
- Recalling from LTM involves reconstruction of the information

### Forgetting

- Fading: People forget things that are not used
- Retrieval failure: Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon
- Interference: Something over shadows the knowledge, or a similar piece of information causes confusion
- Repression or suppression: Forgetting because a person subconsciously does not want to remember

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-37](/_references/AIH/3-37)

## Retention of Learning

- Praise stimulate remembering
- Recall is promoted by association
- Favorable attitudes help retention
- Learning with all senses is most effective
- Meaningful repetition aids recall
- Mnemonics

[Aviation Instructor's Handbook pg. 3-38](/_references/AIH/3-38)

## Transfer of Learning

> The process of applying knowledge from one context in a new situation.

### Types of Transfer

- Near/far
  - Near transfer: applying information in a closely-related area
  - Far transfer: applying information in a novel situation which share some common structure with the original scenario
- Positive/negative
  - Position transfer: When previous information aids in the learning and understanding of new information
  - Negative transfer: When previous information conflicts or confuses the new skill or information

## Encouraging Transfer

- Habit formation:
  - Encourage students to form good habits early
- How understanding affects memory
  - The more deeply a person thinks about information, the better they will remember it
- Remembering during training
  - Students will need to practice
- Remembering after training
  - Continued practice is key to remembering information
- Sources of knowledge
  - Learners should seek out other sources of knowledge with different perspective
- Summary of instructor actions
  - Encourage students to use mnemonics
  - Discourage cramming
