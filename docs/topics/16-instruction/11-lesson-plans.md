# Lesson Plans

## Example Lesson Plan: Steep Turns

### Objective

To perform one or two 360&deg; level turns at 45&deg; bank while maintaining a constant airspeed of less than V<sub>A</sub>, and maintaining coordination.

### Motivation

Help to improve situational awareness and develop skill in operating the airplane close the G and maneuvering limits.

### Airmanship

Lookout/clearing turns, blind spots, anchor points

### Elements

1. Banking the airplane, horizontal component of lift
2. Adverse yaw, induced drag
3. Rudder with roll rate
4. Enter below V<sub>A</sub>
5. 360 degree turn
6. Roll out, lead about 1/2 the bank angle
7. Load factor

### Common Errors

- Failure to clear the area
- Excessive pitch change during recovery
- Attempt to recovery prematurely
- Failure to on on specified heading
- Poor coordination

### Completion Standards

- &pm;100 feet altitude
- &pm;10 knots airspeed
- &pm;5 degrees bank
