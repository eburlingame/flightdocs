# Planning Instructional Activities

After developing a [course of training](/docs/topics/instruction/the-teaching-process#course-of-training), an instructor plans course content around the objectives and standards outlined in that course.

## Blocks of Learning

Blocks are units of learning that cover a single part of the overall course objective.

- Blocks should build upon one another
- Given the learners background, the blocks should be sequenced accordingly
- Blocks can provide checkpoints for the learner, which can boost confidence

## Training Syllabus

A syllabus should be a brief but comprehensive outline of the blocks in a training course.

- A good syllabus will have well-defined objectives for each lesson
- A syllabus needs to be flexible enough to adapt to the learners needs, and other disruptions
- Blocks may need to be reordered as required
- Each lesson should include risk management elements to help the learner identify them
- An enhanced syllabus can also include records about each objective

## Lesson Plans

A lesson plan is an outline for a single instructional period.

- Lesson plans should be put into writing
- They can make for excellent record-keeping

### Purpose of the Lesson Plan

- Wisely select materials
- Make sure each part is covered
- Help the instructor present efficiently
- Provide an outline
- Help relate the material to the objectives
- Give inexperienced instructors confidence
- Promote uniformity among multiple instructors
