# Flight Instruction Techniques

## Integrated Flight Instruction

> Flight instruction which emphasizes airplane control using outside visual references and instrument references.

- Introduce all flight maneuvers with both outside reference and instrument references
- For this to be effective, instrument reference should be introduced with the first maneuvers
- Instill good "see and avoid" habit from the start of training
- For VFR operations it can be 80% outside vs 20% inside

## Use of Distractions

Distractions can be useful to ensure the student can deal with

## Positive Exchange of Flight Controls

1. You have the flight controls
   - Tell the student they should take the flight controls
2. I have the flight controls
   - Once they are _ready_ to take the flight controls, they should say they have the controls
3. You have the flight controls
