# Inoperative Equipment

Part [91.213](/_references/14-CFR/91.213) describes how to deal with inoperative equipment in
aircraft used in Part 91 operations.

Generally, if a piece of inoperative equipment is found before a flight your
options are:

- Cancel the flight
- Perform maintenance before the flight
- Defer maintenance of the item

Some instruments and equipment _must_ be repaired before flight, including:

- Those required for specific operations by Part 91, including:
  - Day VFR equipment [91.205(b)](</_references/14-CFR/91.205(b)>)
  - Night VFR equipment [91.205(c)](</_references/14-CFR/91.205(c)>)
  - IFR equipment [91.205(d)](</_references/14-CFR/91.205(d)>)
- Those required for airworthiness of the aircraft
- Those required per the Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL)
- Those required by an AD to be operative

There are two way to defer maintain for inoperative equipment:

- The deferral provision of 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.213(d) and a
- Or an FAA-approved MEL.

[Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge pg. 9-9](/_references/PHAK/9-9)

## With a Minimum Equipment List

Some aircraft (usually large or complex aircraft) will be certified with a
Minimum Equipment List (MEL). An MEL will specify which equipment can be
inoperable, and how it should be handled.

An MEL is issued to an aircraft's operator via a letter of authorization for a
specific type and registration number. It then becomes mandatory for that
aircraft. With an MEL, equipment cannot be deferred via [91.213d](/_references/14-CFR/91.213d)

If a piece of inoperative is found, it should be noted in the aircraft
maintenance records, or a record specific to this purpose.

[91.213(a)](</_references/14-CFR/91.213(a)>)

## Without a Minimum Equipment List

In an airplane without an MEL, maintenance of an inoperative item _can_ be
deferred as long as the equipment is not required per:

- The aircraft's VFR-day type certification
- The aircraft's equipment list, or the
  [Kind of Operations Equipment List (KOEL)](/docs/topics/regulations/airworthiness/koels)
- An applicable AD
- [91.205](/_references/14-CFR/91.205) or any applicable section of Part 91 for the operation being
  conducted

In this case, the equipment shall either be:

- Removed from the cockpit, the cockpit control placarded, and a record made in
  the maintenance log
- Deactivate and placarded "Inoperative"
  - If the deactivation requires maintenance, it must be done by an authorized
    mechanic
