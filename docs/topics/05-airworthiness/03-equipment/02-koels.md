# Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL)

A Kind of Operations Equipment List is a list of systems and equipment that must
be operational for a particular kind of operation (for instance day/night VFR,
IFR, or icing conditions).

They are included in the Limitations section of the FAA-approved
[Flight Manual](/docs/topics/airworthiness/documents/afms).
