# Special Flight Permits

A special flight permit is a Special Airworthiness Certificate authorizing
operation of an aircraft that does not currently meet applicable airworthiness
requirements but is safe for a specific flight.

An A&P mechanic must determine the safety of the aircraft before the permit is
issued, and the inspection shall be recorded in the aircraft records.

A special flight permit can be issued for several reasons, including:

- To fly to base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance can be done
- Delivering or exporting an aircraft
- Evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger
- Allow an overweight aircraft to fly beyond its normal range over water or land
  where landing facilities aren't adequate

A permit can be obtained from the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO),
or Designed Airworthiness Representative (DAR).
