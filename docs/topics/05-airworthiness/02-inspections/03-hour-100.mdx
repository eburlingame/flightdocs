# 100-hour Inspections

100-hour inspections are required for aircraft:

- Under 12,500 lbs. that are used to carry passengers for hire
- Used for flight instruction, where the CFI provides the aircraft

The 100-hour limit may be exceed by no more than 10-hours while en route to a
place where the inspection can be performed.

The 100-hour is done per the Tachometer, not the Hobbs meter.
