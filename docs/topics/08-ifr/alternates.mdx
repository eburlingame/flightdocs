# Alternates

Alternates are required if, within &plusmn; 1 hour of your ETA, [ceilings are &lt; 2000' or visibility is &lt; 3 s.m.](/docs/topics/ifr/ifr-fuel-requirements), or your destination does not have an instrument approach.

## Selecting an Alternate

- If an alternate is required, they must be selected based on the following criteria:
  - For an airports with a **precision** approach, the weather must be better than:
    - **> 600' ceiling**, and
    - **> 2 s.m. visibility**
  - For an airports with a **non-precision** approach, the weather must be better than:
    - **> 800' ceiling**, and
    - **> 2 s.m. visibility**
  - If an airport contains a negative A on its approach plates, then it has non-standard alternate minimums.
    - ![Negative A symbol](/img/content/kcvo-vor-a-header.png)
  - In this case refer to the Alternate Minimums chart for the airport in the TPP:
    - ![Alternative minimums](/img/content/kcvo-alternate-mins.png)
  - If an airport does not have an instrument approach, it can be used as an alternate if:
    - A decent to landing can be made from the **MEA** to the airport in basic VFR conditions
  - If the chart contains a negative "A" followed by "NA", then that airport cannot be used as an alternate.
    - This may be because the airport does not have weather reporting

## Forecasted Weather

- TAFs are an acceptable source for the forecast weather minimums above
- If an airport does not have a TAF, [graphical ceiling/visibility forecasts](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#cigvis) can be used

## Alternate While Flying

- There is no requirement to fly to your filed alternate if a landing at the intended destination cannot be made.
- You can fly an approach into any airport, provided the minimums are higher than the approach used

## RNAV Approaches

- When using WAAS at an alternate airport, flight planning must be based on flying the RNAV (GPS) LNAV or circling minima line, or minima on a GPS approach procedure
