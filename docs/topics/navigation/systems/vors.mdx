# VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR)

VORs operate within the 108.0 to 117.95 MHz frequency band and have a power
output necessary to provide coverage within their assigned operational service
volume. They are subject to line-of-sight restrictions, and the range varies
proportionally to the altitude of the receiving equipment.

- During periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code
  (- ● ●●● -) or the code may be removed
- Most VORs are equipped for voice transmission on the VOR frequency. VORs
  without voice capability are indicated by the letter “W” (without voice)
  included in the class designator (VORW).
