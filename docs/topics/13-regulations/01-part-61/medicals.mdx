<Reg showTitle part="67" /> contains the specific medical requirements needed for
a medical certificate, along with disqualifying medical conditions.

A higher-class medical can be used in place of a lower class one.

For example, suppose a pilot receives a first-class medical certificate:

- He or she can exercise the privileges of the first class medical for one year
  following it's issuance
  - During this first year they can exercise the privileges of ATP, commercial,
    or private pilot
- After one year, the medical can be used in lieu of a third class medical (for
  private pilot operations, instructing, etc.)
  - The certificate will remain valid for 4 more years (if under the age of 40)
  - Or, one more year (if over the age of 40), just as a 3rd class certificate
    would

See <Reg part="61.23(d)" /> for details.

Even when a pilot holds a valid medical certificate, they cannot act as PIC if
they "know of any medical condition that would make the person unable to meet
the requirements for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot
operation." - <Reg part="61.53" />
