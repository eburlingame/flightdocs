  - This is only given if you gave the ground instruction
  - [AC 61-65 A.82](/_references/AC-61-65/A.82) is used if the student used a home study course
- [AC 61-65 A.35](/_references/AC-61-65/A.35): private student is prepared for the practical test (needed along with A.1 and A.2)

## Scenarios

### Commercial helicopter to commercial ASEL

- Adding a category at the same level
- Look at [61.63(b)](/_references/14-CFR/61.63), which states:

- No knowledge test

### Commercial multi-engine to commercial ASEL

- Adding a class rating at the same level (commercial to commercial)
- Look at [61.63(c)](/_references/14-CFR/61.63), which states:
  - No need for 61.129 aeronautical experience
  - Need training in 61.127
  - Need training in the 61.127 operation areas
