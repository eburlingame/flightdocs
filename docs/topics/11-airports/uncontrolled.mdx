## Using the Traffic Patterns

From the AIM:

Key to traffic pattern operations

1. Enter pattern in level flight, abeam the midpoint of the runway, at pattern
   altitude.
2. Maintain pattern altitude until abeam approach end of the landing runway on
   downwind leg.
3. Complete turn to final at least **1/4 mile** from the runway.
4. Continue straight ahead until beyond departure end of runway.
5. If remaining in the traffic pattern, commence turn to crosswind leg beyond
   the departure end of the runway within **300 feet** of pattern altitude.
6. If departing the traffic pattern, continue straight out, or exit with a 45
   degree turn (to the left for a left-pattern; to the right for a right
   pattern) beyond the departure end of the runway, after reaching pattern
   altitude.
