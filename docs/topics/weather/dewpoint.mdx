# Dewpoint

The dewpoint is the temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated
with water vapor.

## Temperature / Dewpoint Spread

The difference between the ambient temperature and the dewpoint determines the
relative humidity of the air, and whether clouds and fog are likely to form.

- When the temperature and the dewpoint are the same, relatively humidity is
  100%
- When the temperature is withim 5&deg; C of the dewpoint, clouds, dew, and fog
  are likely
  - This is also the most favorable conditions for carburetor icing
