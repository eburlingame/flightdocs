# Takeoffs

## Normal Takeoffs

Safely transition from ground movement to flight.

### Operation

- Make sure nose wheel is straight, especially if stopped
- Use rudder to keep going straight down the runway
- As you accelerate, the rudder will become more effective
- At rotation speed do a smooth rotation to a constant climb attitude
- Aircraft should accelerate after rotation

## Short-Field Takeoff

Takeoff minimizes the takeoff roll.

### Operation

- Hold the brakes, make sure nose-wheel is straight
- Release brakes with slightly tail-low altitude
- Hold elevator back pressure and climb out at $V_x$

## Soft-Field Takeoff

Simulated takeoff from a soft runway.

### Operation

- Rolling takeoff, keeping momentum when turning onto the runway
- Elevator full-aft
- Keep nose-wheel as high as we can until we add power
- The airplane will lift off early, then push over into ground effect
- In ground effect, accelerate to Vx or Vy as appropriate
- Once at Vx or Vy climb away as normal

## Crosswind Takeoff

- Taxiing onto the runway turn ailerons completely into the crosswind
- As you accelerate and controls become effective, use aileron to keep the wings level
- As you lift off, use a momentary sideslip to keep the airplane aligned with the runway
- After climbing out, transition to a crab angle to reduce drag
