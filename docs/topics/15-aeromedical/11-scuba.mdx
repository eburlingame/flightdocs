# SCUBA Diving and Flying

The recommended waiting time before going to flight altitudes of up to 8,000
feet is at least **12 hours** after diving that does not require controlled
ascent (non-decompression stop diving), and at least **24 hours** after diving
that does require controlled ascent (decompression stop diving).

The waiting time before going to flight altitudes above 8,000 feet should be at
least 24 hours after any SCUBA dive. These recommended altitudes are actual
flight altitudes above mean sea level (MSL) and not pressurized cabin altitudes.
This takes into consideration the risk of decompression of the aircraft during
flight.
