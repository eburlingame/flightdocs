# Hypoxia

Hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair
functions of the brain and other organs.

Hypoxia is caused by the reduction of barometric pressure at altitude (the
concentration of oxygen actually stays relatively constant).

## Symptoms

- Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips)
- Headache
- Decreased response to stimuli and increased reaction time
- Impaired judgment
- Euphoria
- Visual impairment
- Drowsiness
- Lightheaded or dizzy sensation
- Tingling in fingers and toes
- Numbness

## Onset

- Hypoxia can affect many pilots as low as **5000' MSL** at night
- In the day, typical pilots are not greatly impaired below **12,000'**
- At cabin pressure altitudes above **15,000** feet:
  - The periphery field of vision grays until only a central point remains
    vision remains (tunnel vision)
  - A blue coloration (cyanosis) of the fingernails and lips develops
- The ability to take corrective action is lost in **20 to 30 minutes** at
  18,000 feet
- It is lost in **5â€‰to 12 minutes** at 20,000 feet, followed soon thereafter by
  unconsciousness.

For optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above
10,000 feet during the day, and above 5,000 feet at night.

## Types

- **Hypoxic** hypoxia: Caused by the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at
  high altitude
- **Hypemic** hypoxia: Caused by the blood not being able to take up and
  transport a sufficient amount of oxygen
- **Stagnant** hypoxia: Caused by a lack of circulation of oxygenated blood in
  the body
- **Histotoxic** hypoxia: Caused by the inability of the cells to effectively
  use oxygen
