# Dehydration

## Causes

Dehydration is the term given to a critical loss of water from the body.

Contributing factors:

- Hot flight decks and flight lines
- Wind
- Humidity
- Diuretic drinks:
  - Coffee
  - Tea
  - Alcohol
  - Caffeinated soft drinks

### Heatstroke

Heatstroke is a condition caused by any inability of the body
to control its temperature.

It has similar symptoms to that of dehydration, but also has been known to be recognized only upon complete collapse.

## Symptoms

- Fatigue
- Drowsiness
- Confusion
- Disorientation

## Corrective Actions

- Note that our body's "thirst mechanism" usually responds too late
- Drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes
