# GPS and RNAV Approaches

Depending on the capabilities of the RNAV system, different minimums may apply.

## RNAV Approaches

### LNAV Minima

Non-WAAS GPS systems use the LNAV line of minima. These approaches from left/right lateral guidance only (no glideslope), and are flown like a non-precision approach with step-down fixes. They also don't have angular guidance like an ILS or LPV.

### LNAV/VNAV Minima

Some large aircraft are equipped have non-WAAS GPS, but have additional baro-aiding capabilities that allow them to use the LNAV/VNAV line of minimums. (A WAAS-enabled GPS can also fly an LNAV/VNAV, but usually there is an LPV available and it will select that instead.)

Like an LNAV, these do not have angular lateral guidance and have higher minimums than LPV.

LNAV/LNAV also provide vertical guidance, using a glideslope computed by the GPS.

### LPV (localizer-performance with vertical guidance) Minima

WAAS-enabled GPS units can fly LPV approaches, which provide ILS-like minimums. Like an ILS-these provide angular lateral guidance to the runway, with a 700 foot width at the threshold. Unlike an ILS though, the sensitivity remains with a 700 width as you travel down the runway.

LPVs also provide ILS-like vertical guidance, using a glideslope generated by the GPS unit.

### LP (localizer performance) Minima

In some cases, terrain or obstructions do not allow publication of vertically guided LPV minima, in which case LP minimums will be published. Similar to a LOC approaches, these provide ILS-like lateral guidance, but no vertical guidance. They are flown with a MDA and step down fixes.

### RNAV Approach Sensitivities

Below are the approach sensitivities, indicated by full-scale deflection of the CDI:

## GPS Overlay Approaches

GPS overlay approaches are designated non-precision instrument approach procedures that pilots are authorized to fly using GPS avionics.

They have names like `VOR/DME or GPS RWY 15`. Note that GPS-equipped aircraft do not need underlying ground-based NAVAIDs or VOR/DME avionics to fly the approach.
