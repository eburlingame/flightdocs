# Precision Approaches

Precision approaches are instrument approaches that provide both lateral and vertical guidance to the runway. Precision approaches are categorized as either ILS or GLS approaches.

## ILS Approaches

The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision guidance to stabilize and aircraft's approach towards a runway. The ILS consists of two main components: the localizer and the glideslope.

## GLS Approaches

The Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Landing System (GLS) is a satellite-based augmentation system that provides precision guidance towards a runway. The GLS system uses a ground-based station, usually located near the airport, to provide differential corrections to the GPS signal to provide precision guidance.

GLS approaches are usually flown by large commercial aircraft.
