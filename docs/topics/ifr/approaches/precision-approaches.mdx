# Precision Approaches

Precision approaches provide both lateral and vertical guidance to the runway.

## ILS Approaches

An Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a ground-based instrument approach system that uses two systems on the ground:the localizer and the glideslope.

## GLS Approaches

The Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Landing System (GLS) is a satellite-based augmentation system that provides precision guidance towards a runway. The GLS system uses a ground-based station, usually located near the airport, to provide differential corrections to the GPS signal to provide precision guidance.

GLS approaches are usually flown by large commercial aircraft.
