# Non-Precision Approaches

Non-precision approaches provide lateral guidance to the runway. They utilize a series of step-down fixes and **minimum decent altitude (MDA)** to guide an aircraft towards the runway. They provide high minimums than precision approaches.

## VOR and VOR/DME Approaches

VOR approaches use a VOR as a primary means of navigation to the vicinity of a runway. Some approaches require the use of DME as well.
