# Circling Approaches

Performing an instrument approach procedure which is not aligned with the runway of intended landing will require a circle-to-land maneuver.

## Circle-to-land Maneuver

The circling maneuver must be done within the circling approach protected area, which is defined by the tangential connection of arcs drawn from each runway end.

## Circling-only approaches

Straight-in IAPs are identified by the navigational system providing the final approach guidance and the runway to which the approach is aligned (e.g., VOR RWY 13). Circling only approaches are identified by the navigational system providing final approach guidance and a letter (e.g., VOR A).
