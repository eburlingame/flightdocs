# Circling Approaches

- Circling approaches are used when an approach does not align with the runway of intended landing.
- They can also be used when a descent to the runway from the MDA would require a high descent rate that wouldn't be safe

## Circle-to-land Maneuver

- Circling to land is a maneuver that should be performed with care as it is flown near the ground at approach airspeeds
- Maneuver to the runway of intended landing **at or above the circling MDA**, maintaining visual contact with the airport or runway environment
- Decent from the MDA can only be done when a landing is assured using a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers
- The circling approach area provides protection from obstacles near the airport, and is defined by a radius from each runway end:

- Before flying a circling approach, consider the speed of your aircraft and use the [appropriate minimums for that category](/docs/topics/ifr/approaches/approach-categories)
- The faster the aircraft the larger the approach radius, and thus the higher the minimums.
  - The following chart from the TPP defines the radii for the different categories:

- The "negative C" symbol on the circling line indicates an **expanded** circling area has been established

## Circling-only approaches

- Circling only approaches are identified by the navigational system providing final approach guidance and a letter (e.g., VOR A), as opposed to a straight-in approach which will have the runway in the name (e.g. VOR/DME 13)
